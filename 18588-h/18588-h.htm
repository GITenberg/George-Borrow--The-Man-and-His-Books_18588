<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>The late Dr. W. I. Knapp&rsquo;s Life (John Murray) and Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
prefaces are the fountains of information about Borrow, and I have clearly
indicated how much I owe to them.&nbsp; What I owe to my friend, Mr.
Thomas Seccombe, cannot be so clearly indicated, but his prefaces have
been meat and drink to me.&nbsp; I have also used Mr. R. A. J. Walling&rsquo;s
sympathetic and interesting &ldquo;George Borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The British
and Foreign Bible Society has given me permission to quote from Borrow&rsquo;s
letters to the Society, edited in 1911 by the Rev. T. H. Darlow; and
Messrs. T. C. Cantrill and J. Pringle have put at my disposal their
publication of Borrow&rsquo;s journal of his second Welsh tour, wonderfully
annotated by themselves (&ldquo;Y Cymmrodor,&rdquo; 1910).&nbsp; These
and other sources are mentioned where they are used and in the bibliography.</p>
<h2>DEDICATION TO E. S. P. HAYNES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Haynes</span>,</p>
<p>By dedicating this book to you, I believe it is my privilege to introduce
you and Borrow.&nbsp; This were sufficient reason for the dedication.&nbsp;
The many better reasons are beyond my eloquence, much though I have
remembered them this winter, listening to the storms of Caermarthen
Bay, the screams of pigs, and the street tunes of &ldquo;Fall in and
follow me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yip-i-addy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The first good
joy that Mary had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yours,<br />

I&mdash;BORROW&rsquo;S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>The subject of this book was a man who was continually writing about
himself, whether openly or in disguise.&nbsp; He was by nature inclined
to thinking about himself and when he came to write he naturally wrote
about himself; and his inclination was fortified by the obvious impression
made upon other men by himself and by his writings.&nbsp; He has been
dead thirty years; much has been written about him by those who knew
him or knew those that did: yet the impression still made by him, and
it is one of the most powerful, is due mainly to his own books.&nbsp;
Nor has anything lately come to light to provide another writer on Borrow
with an excuse.&nbsp; The impertinence of the task can be tempered only
by its apparent hopelessness and by that necessity which Voltaire did
not see.</p>
<p>I shall attempt only a re-arrangement of the myriad details accessible
to all in the writings of Borrow and about Borrow.&nbsp; Such re-arrangement
will sometimes heighten the old effects and sometimes modify them.&nbsp;
The total impression will, I hope, not be a smaller one, though it must
inevitably be softer, less clear, less isolated, less gigantic.&nbsp;
I do not wish, and I shall not try, to deface Borrow&rsquo;s portrait
of himself; I can only hope that I shall not do it by accident.&nbsp;
There may be a sense in which that portrait can be called inaccurate.&nbsp;
It may even be true that &ldquo;lies&mdash;damned lies&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
helped to make it.&nbsp; But nobody else knows anything like as much
about the truth, and a peddling <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>biographer&rsquo;s
mouldy fragment of plain fact may be far more dangerous than the manly
lying of one who was in possession of all the facts.&nbsp; In most cases
the fact&mdash;to use an equivocal term&mdash;is dead and blown away
in dust while Borrow&rsquo;s impression is as green as grass.&nbsp;
His &ldquo;lies&rdquo; are lies only in the same sense as all clothing
is a lie.</p>
<p>For example, he knew a Gypsy named Ambrose Smith, and had sworn brotherhood
with him as a boy.&nbsp; He wrote about this Gypsy, man and boy, and
at first called him, as the manuscripts bear witness, by his real name,
though Borrow thought of him in 1842 as Petulengro.&nbsp; In print he
was given the name Jasper Petulengro&mdash;Petulengro being Gypsy for
shoesmith&mdash;and as Jasper Petulengro he is now one of the most unforgetable
of heroes; the name is the man, and for many Englishmen his form and
character have probably created quite a new value for the name of Jasper.&nbsp;
Well, Jasper Petulengro lives.&nbsp; Ambrose Smith died in 1878, at
the age of seventy-four, after being visited by the late Queen Victoria
at Knockenhair Park: he was buried in Dunbar Cemetery. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a></p>
<p>In the matter of his own name Borrow made another creative change
of a significant kind.&nbsp; He was christened George Henry Borrow on
July 17th (having been born on the 5th), 1803, at East Dereham, in Norfolk.&nbsp;
As a boy he signed his name, George Henry Borrow.&nbsp; As a young man
of the Byronic age and a translator of Scandinavian literature, he called
himself in print, George Olaus Borrow.&nbsp; His biographer, Dr. William
Ireland Knapp, says that Borrow&rsquo;s first name &ldquo;expressed
the father&rsquo;s admiration for the reigning monarch,&rdquo; George
III.; but there is no reason to believe this, and certainly Borrow himself
made of the combination which he finally adopted&mdash;George Borrow&mdash;something
that retains not the slightest flavour of any other <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>George.&nbsp;
Such changes are common enough.&nbsp; John Richard Jefferies becomes
Richard Jefferies; Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson becomes Robert Louis
Stevenson.&nbsp; But Borrow could touch nothing without transmuting
it.&nbsp; For example, in his Byronic period, when he was about twenty
years of age, he was translating &ldquo;romantic ballads&rdquo; from
the Danish.&nbsp; In the last verse of one of these, called &ldquo;Elvir
Hill,&rdquo; he takes the liberty of using the Byronic &ldquo;lay&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis therefore I counsel each young Danish swain
who may ride in the forest so dreary,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er to lay down upon lone Elvir Hill though he chance to be
ever so weary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty years later he used this ballad romantically in writing about
his early childhood.&nbsp; He was travelling with his father&rsquo;s
regiment from town to town and from school to school, and they came
to Berwick-upon-Tweed: <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass that, one morning, I found myself extended
on the bank of a river.&nbsp; It was a beautiful morning of early spring;
small white clouds were floating in the heaven, occasionally veiling
the countenance of the sun, whose light, as they retired, would again
burst forth, coursing like a racehorse over the scene&mdash;and a goodly
scene it was!&nbsp; Before me, across the water, on an eminence, stood
a white old city, surrounded with lofty walls, above which rose the
tops of tall houses, with here and there a church or steeple.&nbsp;
To my right hand was a long and massive bridge, with many arches and
of antique architecture, which traversed the river.&nbsp; The river
was a noble one; the broadest that I had hitherto seen.&nbsp; Its waters,
of a greenish tinge, poured with impetuosity beneath the narrow arches
to meet the sea, close at hand, as the boom of the billows breaking
distinctly upon a beach declared.&nbsp; There were songs upon the river
from the fisher-barks; <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and
occasionally a chorus, plaintive and wild, such as I had never heard
before, the words of which I did not understand, but which at the present
time, down the long avenue of years, seem in memory&rsquo;s ear to sound
like &lsquo;Horam, coram, dago.&rsquo;&nbsp; Several robust fellows
were near me, some knee-deep in water, employed in hauling the seine
upon the strand.&nbsp; Huge fish were struggling amidst the meshes&mdash;princely
salmon&mdash;their brilliant mail of blue and silver flashing in the
morning beam; so goodly and gay a scene, in truth, had never greeted
my boyish eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as I gazed upon the prospect, my bosom began to heave,
and my tears to trickle.&nbsp; Was it the beauty of the scene which
gave rise to these emotions?&nbsp; Possibly; for though a poor ignorant
child&mdash;a half-wild creature&mdash;I was not insensible to the loveliness
of nature, and took pleasure in the happiness and handiworks of my fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
Yet, perhaps, in something more deep and mysterious the feeling which
then pervaded me might originate.&nbsp; Who can lie down on Elvir Hill
without experiencing something of the sorcery of the place?&nbsp; Flee
from Elvir Hill, young swain, or the maids of Elle will have power over
you, and you will go elf-wild!&mdash;so say the Danes.&nbsp; I had unconsciously
laid myself down on haunted ground; and I am willing to imagine that
what I then experienced was rather connected with the world of spirits
and dreams than with what I actually saw and heard around me.&nbsp;
Surely the elves and genii of the place were conversing, by some inscrutable
means, with the principle of intelligence lurking within the poor uncultivated
clod!&nbsp; Perhaps to that ethereal principle the wonders of the past,
as connected with that stream, the glories of the present, and even
the history of the future, were at that moment being revealed!&nbsp;
Of how many feats of chivalry had those old walls been witness, when
hostile kings contended for their possession?&mdash;how many an army
from the south and from the north had trod <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>that
old bridge?&mdash;what red and noble blood had crimsoned those rushing
waters?&mdash;what strains had been sung, ay, were yet being sung on
its banks?&mdash;some soft as Doric reed; some fierce and sharp as those
of Norwegian Skaldaglam; some as replete with wild and wizard force
as Finland&rsquo;s runes, singing of Kalevale&rsquo;s moors, and the
deeds of Woinomoinen!&nbsp; Honour to thee, thou island stream!&nbsp;
Onward mayst thou ever roll, fresh and green, rejoicing in thy bright
past, thy glorious present, and in vivid hope of a triumphant future!&nbsp;
Flow on, beautiful one!&mdash;which of the world&rsquo;s streams canst
thou envy, with thy beauty and renown?&nbsp; Stately is the Danube,
rolling in its might through lands romantic with the wild exploits of
Turk, Polak, and Magyar!&nbsp; Lovely is the Rhine! on its shelvy banks
grows the racy grape; and strange old keeps of robber-knights of yore
are reflected in its waters, from picturesque crags and airy headlands!&mdash;yet
neither the stately Danube, nor the beauteous Rhine, with all their
fame, though abundant, needst thou envy, thou pure island stream!&mdash;and
far less yon turbid river of old, not modern renown, gurgling beneath
the walls of what was once proud Rome, towering Rome, Jupiter&rsquo;s
town, but now vile Rome, crumbling Rome, Batuscha&rsquo;s town, far
less needst thou envy the turbid Tiber of bygone fame, creeping sadly
to the sea, surcharged with the abominations of modern Rome&mdash;how
unlike to thee, thou pure island stream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this passage Borrow concentrates upon one scene the feelings of
three remote periods of his life.&nbsp; He gives the outward scene as
he remembers it forty years after, and together with the thoughts which
now come into his mind.&nbsp; He gives the romantic suggestion from
one of the favourite ballads of his youth, &ldquo;Elvir Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He gives the child himself weeping, he knows not why.&nbsp; Yet the
passage is one and indivisible.</p>
<p>These, at any rate, are not &ldquo;lies&mdash;damned lies.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
II&mdash;HIS OWN HERO</h2>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s principal study was himself, and in all his best books
he is the chief subject and the chief object.&nbsp; Yet when he came
to write confessedly and consecutively about himself he found it no
easy task.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp gives an interesting account of the stages
by which he approached and executed it.&nbsp; His first mature and original
books, &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Gypsies of Spain,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; had a solid body of subject matter
more or less interesting in itself, and anyone with a pen could have
made it acceptable to the public which desires information.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Bible of Spain&rdquo; was the book of the year 1843, read by everybody
in one or other of the six editions published in the first twelve months.&nbsp;
These books were also full of himself.&nbsp; Even &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo;
written for the most part in Spain, when he was a man of about thirty
and had no reason for expecting the public to be interested in himself,
especially in a Gypsy crowd&mdash;even that early book prophesied very
different things.&nbsp; He said in the &ldquo;preface&rdquo; that he
bore the Gypsies no ill-will, for he had known them &ldquo;for upwards
of twenty years, in various countries, and they never injured a hair
of his head, or deprived him of a shred of his raiment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The motive for this forbearance, he said, was that they thought him
a Gypsy.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;introduction&rdquo; he satisfied some curiosity,
but raised still more, when speaking of the English Gypsies and especially
of their eminence &ldquo;in those disgraceful and brutalising exhibitions
called pugilistic combats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a boy of fourteen,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I was present
at a <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>prize
fight; why should I hide the truth?&nbsp; It took place on a green meadow,
beside a running stream, close by the old church of E---, and within
a league of the ancient town of N---, the capital of one of the eastern
counties.&nbsp; The terrible Thurtell was present, lord of the concourse;
for wherever he moved he was master, and whenever he spoke, even when
in chains, every other voice was silent.&nbsp; He stood on the mead,
grim and pale as usual, with his bruisers around.&nbsp; He it was, indeed,
who <i>got up</i> the fight, as he had previously done with respect
to twenty others; it being his frequent boast that he had first introduced
bruising and bloodshed amidst rural scenes, and transformed a quiet
slumbering town into a den of Jews and metropolitan thieves.&nbsp; Some
time before the commencement of the combat, three men, mounted on wild-looking
horses, came dashing down the road in the direction of the meadow, in
the midst of which they presently showed themselves, their horses clearing
the deep ditches with wonderful alacrity.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
Gypsy Will and his gang,&rsquo; lisped a Hebrew pickpocket; &lsquo;we
shall have another fight.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word Gypsy was always sufficient
to excite my curiosity, and I looked attentively at the new comers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen Gypsies of various lands, Russian, Hungarian,
and Turkish; and I have also seen the legitimate children of most countries
of the world, but I never saw, upon the whole, three more remarkable
individuals, as far as personal appearance was concerned, than the three
English Gypsies who now presented themselves to my eyes on that spot.&nbsp;
Two of them had dismounted, and were holding their horses by the reins.&nbsp;
The tallest, and, at the first glance, the most interesting of the two,
was almost a giant, for his height could not have been less than six
feet three.&nbsp; It is impossible for the imagination to conceive any
thing more perfectly beautiful than were the features of this man, and
the most skilful sculptor of Greece might <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>have
taken them as his model for a hero and a god.&nbsp; The forehead was
exceedingly lofty&mdash;a rare thing in a Gypsy; the nose less Roman
than Grecian&mdash;fine yet delicate; the eyes large, overhung with
long drooping lashes, giving them almost a melancholy expression; it
was only when they were highly elevated that the Gypsy glance peered
out, if that can be called glance which is a strange stare, like nothing
else in this world.&nbsp; His complexion&mdash;a beautiful olive; and
his teeth of a brilliancy uncommon even amongst these people, who have
all fine teeth.&nbsp; He was dressed in a coarse waggoner&rsquo;s slop,
which, however, was unable to conceal altogether the proportions of
his noble and Herculean figure.&nbsp; He might be about twenty-eight.&nbsp;
His companion and his captain, Gypsy Will, was, I think, fifty when
he was hanged, ten years subsequently (for I never afterwards lost sight
of him), in the front of the jail of Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp; I have
still present before me his bushy black hair, his black face, and his
big black eyes, full and thoughtful, but fixed and staring.&nbsp; His
dress consisted of a loose blue jockey coat, jockey boots and breeches;
in his hand a huge jockey whip, and on his head (it struck me at the
time for its singularity) a broad-brimmed, high-peaked Andalusian hat,
or at least one very much resembling those generally worn in that province.&nbsp;
In stature he was shorter than his more youthful companion, yet he must
have measured six feet at least, and was stronger built, if possible.&nbsp;
What brawn!&mdash;what bone!&mdash;what legs!&mdash;what thighs!&nbsp;
The third Gypsy, who remained on horseback, looked more like a phantom
than any thing human.&nbsp; His complexion was the colour of pale dust,
and of that same colour was all that pertained to him, hat and clothes.&nbsp;
His boots were dusty of course, for it was midsummer, and his very horse
was of a dusty dun.&nbsp; His features were whimsically ugly, most of
his teeth were gone, and as to his age, he might be thirty or sixty.&nbsp;
He <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was
somewhat lame and halt, but an unequalled rider when once upon his steed,
which he was naturally not very solicitous to quit.&nbsp; I subsequently
discovered that he was considered the wizard of the gang.</p>
<p class="picture">
<a href="images/page9.jpg">
<img alt="John Thurtell.  (From an old print.)" src="images/page9.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been already prolix with respect to these Gypsies,
but I will not leave them quite yet.&nbsp; The intended combatants at
length arrived; it was necessary to clear the ring&mdash;always a troublesome
and difficult task.&nbsp; Thurtell went up to the two Gypsies, with
whom he seemed to be acquainted, and, with his surly smile, said two
or three words, which I, who was standing by, did not understand.&nbsp;
The Gypsies smiled in return, and giving the reins of their animals
to their mounted companion, immediately set about the task which the
king of the flash-men had, as I conjecture, imposed upon them; this
they soon accomplished.&nbsp; Who could stand against such fellows and
such whips?&nbsp; The fight was soon over&mdash;then there was a pause.&nbsp;
Once more Thurtell came up to the Gypsies and said something&mdash;the
Gypsies looked at each other and conversed; but their words had then
no meaning for my ears.&nbsp; The tall Gypsy shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
well,&rsquo; said the other, in English, &lsquo;I will&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pushing the people aside, he strode to the ropes, over
which he bounded into the ring, flinging his Spanish hat high into the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gypsy Will</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;The best man in England for
twenty pounds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thurtell</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;I am backer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds is a tempting sum, and there were men that day
upon the green meadow who would have shed the blood of their own fathers
for the fifth of the price.&nbsp; But the Gypsy was not an unknown man,
his prowess and strength were notorious, and no one cared to encounter
him.&nbsp; Some of the Jews looked eager for a moment; but their sharp
eyes quailed quickly before his savage glances, as <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>he
towered in the ring, his huge form dilating, and his black features
convulsed with excitement.&nbsp; The Westminster bravos eyed the Gypsy
askance; but the comparison, if they made any, seemed by no means favourable
to themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gypsy! rum chap.&mdash;Ugly customer,&mdash;always
in training.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such were the exclamations which I heard,
some of which at that period of my life I did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man would fight the Gypsy.&mdash;Yes! a strong country
fellow wished to win the stakes, and was about to fling up his hat in
defiance, but he was prevented by his friends, with&mdash;&lsquo;Fool!
he&rsquo;ll kill you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Gypsies were mounting their horses, I heard the dusty
phantom exclaim&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Brother, you are an arrant ring-maker and a horse-breaker;
you&rsquo;ll make a hempen ring to break your own neck of a horse one
of these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They pressed their horses&rsquo; flanks, again leaped over
the ditches, and speedily vanished, amidst the whirlwinds of dust which
they raised upon the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of the phantom Gypsy were ominous.&nbsp; Gypsy Will
was eventually executed for a murder committed in his early youth, in
company with two English labourers, one of whom confessed the fact on
his death-bed.&nbsp; He was the head of the clan Young, which, with
the clan Smith, still haunts two of the eastern counties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this, Borrow said in the same book that this would probably
be the last occasion he would have to speak of the Gypsies or anything
relating to them.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; written
and revised several years later, he changed his mind.&nbsp; He wrote
plenty about Gypsies and still more about himself.&nbsp; When he wished
to show the height of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mendizabal, he called
him &ldquo;a huge athletic man, somewhat taller than myself, who measure
six feet two without my shoes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>informed
the public that when he met an immense dog in strolling round the ruins
above Monte Moro, he stooped till his chin nearly touched his knee and
looked the animal full in the face, &ldquo;and, as John Leyden says,
in the noblest ballad which the Land of Heather has produced:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The hound he yowled, and back he fled,<br />
As struck with fairy charm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When his servant Lopez was imprisoned at Villallos, Borrow had reason
to fear that the man would be sacrificed to political opponents in that
violent time, so, as he told the English minister at Madrid, he bore
off Lopez, single-handed and entirely unarmed, through a crowd of at
least one hundred peasants, and furthermore shouted: &ldquo;Hurrah for
Isabella the Second.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as for mystery, &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain&rdquo; abounds with invitations to admiration and curiosity.&nbsp;
Let one example suffice.&nbsp; He had come back to Seville from a walk
in the country when a man emerging from an archway looked in his face
and started back, &ldquo;exclaiming in the purest and most melodious
French: &lsquo;What do I see?&nbsp; If my eyes do not deceive me&mdash;it
is himself.&nbsp; Yes, the very same as I saw him first at Bayonne;
then long subsequently beneath the brick wall at Novgorod; then beside
the Bosphorus; and last at&mdash;at&mdash;O my respectable and cherished
friend, where was it that I had last the felicity of seeing your well-remembered
and most remarkable physiognomy?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrows answers: &ldquo;It was in the south of Ireland, if I mistake
not.&nbsp; Was it not there that I introduced you to the sorcerer who
tamed the savage horses by a single whisper into their ear?&nbsp; But
tell me, what brings you to Spain and Andalusia, the last place where
I should have expected to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron Taylor (Isidore Justin Severin, Baron Taylor, 1789-1879) now
introduces him to a friend as &ldquo;My most cherished and respectable
friend, one who is better <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>acquainted
with Gypsy ways than the Chef de Boh&eacute;miens &agrave; Triana, one
who is an expert whisperer and horse-sorcerer, and who, to his honour
I say it, can wield hammer and tongs, and handle a horse-shoe, with
the best of the smiths amongst the Alpujarras of Granada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow then lightly portrays his accomplished and extraordinary cosmopolitan
friend, with the conclusion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has visited most portions of the earth, and it is remarkable
enough that we are continually encountering each other in strange places
and under singular circumstances.&nbsp; Whenever he descries me, whether
in the street or the desert, the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin haimas,
at Novgorod or Stamboul, he flings up his arms and exclaims, &lsquo;O
ciel!&nbsp; I have again the felicity of seeing my cherished and most
respectable B---.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow could not avoid making himself impressive and mysterious.&nbsp;
He was impressive and mysterious without an effort; the individual or
the public was impressed, and he was naturally tempted to be more impressive.&nbsp;
Thus, in December of the year 1832 he had to go to London for his first
meeting with the Bible Society, who had been recommended to give him
work where he could use his knowledge of languages.&nbsp; As he was
at Norwich, the distance was a hundred and twelve miles, and as he was
poor he walked.&nbsp; He spent fivepence-halfpenny on a pint of ale,
half-pint of milk, a roll of bread and two apples during the journey,
which took him twenty-seven hours.&nbsp; He reached the Society&rsquo;s
office early in the morning and waited for the secretary.&nbsp; When
the secretary arrived he hoped that Borrow had slept well on his journey.&nbsp;
Borrow said that, as far as he knew, he had not slept, because he had
walked.&nbsp; The secretary&rsquo;s surprise can be imagined from this
alone, or if not, from what followed.&nbsp; For Borrow went on talking,
and told the man, among other things, that he was stolen by Gypsies
when he was a boy&mdash;had <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>passed
several years with them, but had at last been recognised at a fair in
Norfolk, and brought home to his family by an uncle.&nbsp; It was not
to be expected that Borrow would conceal from the public &ldquo;several
years&rdquo; of this kind.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in none of his books
has he so much as hinted at a period of adoption with Gypsies when he
was a boy.&nbsp; Nor has that massive sleuth-hound, Dr. Knapp, discovered
any traces of such an adoption.&nbsp; If there is any foundation for
the story except Borrow&rsquo;s wish to please the secretary, it is
the escapade of his fourteenth or fifteenth year&mdash;when he and three
other boys from Norwich Grammar School played truant, intending to make
caves to dwell in among the sandhills twenty miles away on the coast,
but were recognised on the road, deceitfully detained by a benevolent
gentleman and within a few days brought back, Borrow himself being horsed
on the back of James Martineau, according to the picturesque legend,
for such a thrashing that he had to lie in bed a fortnight and must
bear the marks of it while he was flesh and blood.&nbsp; Borrow celebrated
this escapade by a ballad in dialogue called &ldquo;The Wandering Children
and the Benevolent Gentleman.&nbsp; An Idyll of the Roads.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a">{13a}</a>&nbsp;
There may have been another escapade of the same kind, for Dr Knapp
<a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b">{13b}</a> prints an
account of how Borrow, at the age of fifteen, and two schoolfellows
lived for three days in a cave at Acle when they ought to have been
at school.&nbsp; But his companions were the same in both stories, and
&ldquo;three days in a cave&rdquo; is a very modest increase for such
a story in half-a-century.&nbsp; It was only fifteen years later that
Borrow took revenge upon the truth and told the story of his exile with
the Gypsies.</p>

<p>Probably every man has more or less clearly and more or less constantly
before his mind&rsquo;s eye an ideal self which <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the
real seldom more than approaches.&nbsp; This ideal self may be morally
or in other ways inferior, but it remains the standard by which the
man judges his acts.&nbsp; Some men prove the existence of this ideal
self by announcing now and then that they are misunderstood.&nbsp; Or
they do things which they afterwards condemn as irrelevant or uncharacteristic
and out of harmony.&nbsp; Borrow had an ideal self very clearly before
him when he was writing, and it is probable that in writing he often
described not what he was but what in a better, larger, freer, more
Borrovian world he would have actually become.&nbsp; He admired the
work of his Creator, but he would not affect to be satisfied with it
in every detail, and stepping forward he snatched the brush and made
a bolder line and braver colour.&nbsp; Also he ardently desired to do
more than he ever did.&nbsp; When in Spain he wrote to his friend Hasfeldt
at St. Petersburg, telling him that he wished to visit China by way
of Russia or Constantinople and Armenia.&nbsp; When indignant with the
Bible Society in 1838 he suggested retiring to &ldquo;the Wilds of Tartary
or the Zigani camps of Siberia.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued to suggest
China even after his engagement to Mrs. Clarke.</p>
<p>Just as he played up to the Secretary in conversation, so he played
up to the friends and the public who were allured by the stories left
untold or half-told in &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chief among his encouragers was Richard Ford,
author (in 1845) of the &ldquo;Handbook for Travellers in Spain and
Readers at Home,&rdquo; a man of character and style, learned and a
traveller.&nbsp; In 1841, before &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; appeared,
Ford told Borrow how he wished that he had told more about himself,
and how he was going to hint in a review that Borrow ought to publish
the whole of his adventures for the last twenty years.&nbsp; The publisher&rsquo;s
reader, who saw the manuscript of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; in
1842, suggested that <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Borrow
should prefix a short account of his birth, parentage, education and
life.&nbsp; But already Borrow had taken Ford&rsquo;s hint and was thinking
of an autobiography.&nbsp; By the end of 1842 he was suggesting a book
on his early life, studies and adventures, Gypsies, boxers, philosophers;
and he afterwards announced that &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was planned
and the characters sketched in 1842 and 1843.&nbsp; He saw himself as
a public figure that had to be treated heroically.&nbsp; Read, for example,
his preface to the second edition of &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; dated
March 1, 1843.&nbsp; There he tells of his astonishment at the success
of &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; and of John Murray bidding him not to
think too much of the book but to try again and avoid &ldquo;Gypsy poetry,
dry laws, and compilations from dull Spanish authors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borromeo,&rdquo; he makes Murray say to him, &ldquo;Borromeo,
don&rsquo;t believe all you hear, nor think that you have accomplished
anything so very extraordinary. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, he says, he sat down and began &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He proceeds to make a picture of himself amidst a landscape by some
raving Titanic painter&rsquo;s hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I proceeded slowly,&mdash;sickness
was in the land and the face of nature was overcast,&mdash;heavy rain-clouds
swam in the heavens,&mdash;the blast howled amid the pines which nearly
surround my lonely dwelling, and the waters of the lake which lies before
it, so quiet in general and tranquil, were fearfully agitated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bring lights hither, O Hayim Ben Attar, son of the miracle!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the Jew of Fez brought in the lights, for though it was midday I
could scarcely see in the little room where I was writing. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dreary summer and autumn passed by, and were succeeded by
as gloomy a winter.&nbsp; I still proceeded with &lsquo;The Bible in
Spain.&rsquo;&nbsp; The winter passed and spring came with cold dry
winds and occasional sunshine, whereupon I arose, shouted, and mounting
my horse, even Sidi <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Habismilk,
I scoured all the surrounding district, and thought but little of &lsquo;The
Bible in Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I rode about the country, over the heaths, and through
the green lanes of my native land, occasionally visiting friends at
a distance, and sometimes, for variety&rsquo;s sake, I staid at home
and amused myself by catching huge pike, which lie perdue in certain
deep ponds skirted with lofty reeds, upon my land, and to which there
is a communication from the lagoon by a deep and narrow watercourse.&mdash;I
had almost forgotten &lsquo;The Bible in Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came the summer with much heat and sunshine, and then
I would lie for hours in the sun and recall the sunny days I had spent
in Andalusia, and my thoughts were continually reverting to Spain, and
at last I remembered that &lsquo;The Bible in Spain&rsquo; was still
unfinished; whereupon I arose and said: This loitering profiteth nothing,&mdash;and
I hastened to my summer-house by the side of the lake, and there I thought
and wrote, and every day I repaired to the same place, and thought and
wrote until I had finished &lsquo;The Bible in Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at the proper season &lsquo;The Bible in Spain&rsquo;
was given to the world; and the world, both learned and unlearned, was
delighted with &lsquo;The Bible in Spain,&rsquo; and the highest authority
said, &lsquo;This is a much better book than the Gypsies;&rsquo; and
the next great authority said, &lsquo;Something betwixt Le Sage and
Bunyan.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A far more entertaining work than Don Quixote,&rsquo;
exclaimed a literary lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Another Gil Blas,&rsquo; said
the cleverest writer in Europe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; exclaimed the
cool sensible Spectator, &lsquo;a Gil Blas <i>in water colours</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>Gil Blas</i> in water colours&rdquo;&mdash;that, he says
himself, pleased him better than all the rest.&nbsp; He liked to think
that out of his adventures in distributing Bibles in Spain, out of letters
describing his work to his employers, the Bible Society, he had made
a narrative to be compared <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>with
the fictitious life and adventures of that gentle Spanish rogue, Gil
Blas of Santillana.&nbsp; No wonder that he saw himself a public figure
to be treated reverently, nay! heroically.&nbsp; And so when he comes
to consider somebody&rsquo;s suggestion that the Gypsies are of Jewish
origin, he relates a &ldquo;little adventure&rdquo; of his own, bringing
in Mr. Petulengro and the Jewish servant whom he had brought back with
him after his last visit to Spain.&nbsp; He mounts the heroic figure
upon an heroic horse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it came to pass,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that one day I
was scampering over a heath, at some distance from my present home:
I was mounted upon the good horse Sidi Habismilk, and the Jew of Fez,
swifter than the wind, ran by the side of the good horse Habismilk,
when what should I see at a corner of the heath but the encampment of
certain friends of mine; and the chief of that camp, even Mr. Petulengro,
stood before the encampment, and his adopted daughter, Miss Pinfold,
stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Myself</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Kosko divvus, <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a">{17a}</a>
Mr. Petulengro!&nbsp; I am glad to see you: how are you getting on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Petulengro</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;How am I getting on? as
well as I can.&nbsp; What will you have for that nokengro?&rsquo; <a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b">{17b}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon I dismounted, and delivering the reins of the good
horse to Miss Pinfold, I took the Jew of Fez, even Hayim Ben Attar,
by the hand, and went up to Mr. Petulengro, exclaiming, &lsquo;Sure
ye are two brothers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Anon the Gypsy passed his hand over
the Jew&rsquo;s face, and stared him in the eyes: then turning to me,
he said, &lsquo;We are not dui palor; <a name="citation17c"></a><a href="#footnote17c">{17c}</a>
this man is no Roman; I believe him to be a Jew; he has the face of
one; besides if he were a Rom, even from Jericho, he could rokra a few
words in Rommany.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still more important than this equestrian figure of Borrow on Sidi
Habismilk is the note on &ldquo;The English Dialect <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of
the Rommany&rdquo; hidden away at the end of the second edition of &ldquo;The
Zincali.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tachipen if I jaw &rsquo;doi, I can lel a bit of tan
to hatch: N&rsquo;etist I shan&rsquo;t puch kekomi wafu gorgies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The above sentence, dear reader, I heard from the mouth of
Mr. Petulengro, the last time that he did me the honour to visit me
at my poor house, which was the day after Mol-divvus, <a name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a">{18a}</a>
1842: he stayed with me during the greatest part of the morning, discoursing
on the affairs of Egypt, the aspect of which, he assured me, was becoming
daily worse and worse.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no living for the poor
people, brother,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the chokengres (police) pursue
us from place to place, and the gorgios are become either so poor or
miserly, that they grudge our cattle a bite of grass by the way side,
and ourselves a yard of ground to light a fire upon.&nbsp; Unless times
alter, brother, and of that I see no probability, unless you are made
either poknees or mecralliskoe geiro (justice of the peace or prime
minister), I am afraid the poor persons will have to give up wandering
altogether, and then what will become of them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;However, brother,&rsquo; he continued, in a more cheerful
tone: &lsquo;I am no hindity mush, <a name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b">{18b}</a>
as you well know.&nbsp; I suppose you have not forgot how, fifteen years
ago, when you made horse-shoes in the little dingle by the side of the
great north road, I lent you fifty cottors <a name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c">{18c}</a>
to purchase the wonderful trotting cob of the innkeeper with the green
Newmarket coat, which three days after you sold for two hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, brother, if you had wanted the two hundred, instead
of the fifty, I could have lent them to you, and would have done so,
for I knew you would not be long pazorrhus to me.&nbsp; I am no hindity
mush, brother, no Irishman; I laid <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>out
the other day twenty pounds, in buying ruponoe peamengries; <a name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a">{19a}</a>
and in the Chong-gav, <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b">{19b}</a>
have a house of my own with a yard behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>And</i>, <i>forsooth</i>, <i>if I go thither</i>,
<i>I can choose a place to light a fire upon</i>, <i>and shall have
no necessity to ask leave of these here Gentiles</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear reader, this last is the translation of the Gypsy
sentence which heads the chapter, and which is a very characteristic
specimen of the general way of speaking of the English Gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here be mysteries.&nbsp; The author of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;
is not only taken for a Gypsy, but once upon a time made horse-shoes
in a dingle beside the great north road and trafficked in horses.&nbsp;
When Borrow told John Murray of the Christmas meeting with Ambrose Smith,
whom he now called &ldquo;The Gypsy King,&rdquo; he said he was dressed
in &ldquo;true regal fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the last day of that year
he told Murray that he often meditated on his &ldquo;life&rdquo; and
was arranging scenes.&nbsp; That reminder about the dingle and the wonderful
trotting cob, and the Christmas wine, was stirring his brain.&nbsp;
In two months time he had begun to write his &ldquo;Life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He got back from the Bible Society the letters written to them when
he was their representative in Russia, and these he hoped to use as
he had already used those written in Spain.&nbsp; Ford encouraged him,
saying: &ldquo;Truth is great and always pleases.&nbsp; Never mind nimminy-pimminy
people thinking subjects <i>low</i>.&nbsp; Things are low in manner
of handling.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the midsummer of 1843 Borrow told Murray
that he was getting on&mdash;&ldquo;some parts are very wild and strange,&rdquo;
others are full of &ldquo;useful information.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another
place he called the pictures in it Rembrandts interspersed with Claudes.&nbsp;
At first the book was to have been &ldquo;My Life, a Drama, by George
Borrow&rdquo;; at the end <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of
the year it was &ldquo;Lavengro, a Biography,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;My
Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was writing slowly &ldquo;to please himself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Later on he called it a biography &ldquo;in the Robinson Crusoe style.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nearly three years passed since that meeting with Mr. Petulengro, and
still the book was not ready.&nbsp; Ford had been pressing him to lift
a corner of the curtain which he had gradually let fall over the seven
years of his life preceding his work for the Bible Society, but he made
no promise.&nbsp; He was bent on putting in nothing but his best work,
and avoiding haste.&nbsp; In July, 1848, Murray announced, among his
&ldquo;new works in preparation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lavengro, an Autobiography,
by George Borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first volume went to press in the
autumn, and there was another announcement of &ldquo;Lavengro, an Autobiography,&rdquo;
followed by one of &ldquo;Life, a Drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet again in 1849
the book was announced as &ldquo;Lavengro, an Autobiography,&rdquo;
though the first volume already bore the title, &ldquo;Life, a Drama.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1850 publication was still delayed by Borrow&rsquo;s ill health and
his reluctance to finish and have done with the book.&nbsp; It was still
announced as &ldquo;Lavengro, an Autobiography.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at
the end of the year it was &ldquo;Lavengro: the Scholar&mdash;the Gypsy&mdash;the
Priest,&rdquo; and with that title it appeared early in 1851.&nbsp;
Borrow was then forty-six years old, and the third volume of his book
left him still in the dingle beside the great north road, when he was,
according to the conversation with Mr. Petulengro, a young man of twenty-one.</p>

<h2><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>CHAPTER
III&mdash;PRESENTING THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Life, a Drama,&rdquo; was to have been published in 1849,
and proof sheets with this name and date on the title page were lately
in my hands: as far as page 168 the left hand page heading is &ldquo;A
Dramatic History,&rdquo; which is there crossed out and &ldquo;Life,
a Drama&rdquo; thenceforward substituted.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s corrections
are worth the attention of anyone who cares for men and books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; now opens with the sentence: &ldquo;On an
evening of July, in the year 18--, at East D---, a beautiful little
town in a certain district of East Anglia, I first saw the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proof shows that Borrow preferred &ldquo;a certain district of
East Anglia&rdquo; to &ldquo;The western division of Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here the added shade of indefiniteness can hardly seem valuable to any
but the author himself.&nbsp; In another place he prefers (chapter XIII.)
the vague &ldquo;one of the most glorious of Homer&rsquo;s rhapsodies&rdquo;
to &ldquo;the enchantments of Canidia, the masterpiece of the prince
of Roman poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the second chapter he describes how, near Pett, in Sussex, as
a child less than three years old, he took up a viper without being
injured or even resisted, amid the alarms of his mother and elder brother.&nbsp;
After this description he comments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my firm belief that certain individuals possess an inherent
power, or fascination, over certain creatures, otherwise I should be
unable to account for many feats which I have witnessed, and, indeed,
borne a share in, connected with the taming of brutes and reptiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>This
was in the proof preceded by a passage at first modified and then cut
out, reading thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some parts of the world and more particularly in India
there are people who devote themselves to the pursuit and taming of
serpents.&nbsp; Had I been born in those regions I perhaps should have
been what is termed a snake charmer.&nbsp; That I had a genius for the
profession, as probably all have who follow it, I gave decided proof
of the above instance as in others which I shall have occasion subsequently
to relate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he cut out presumably because it was too &ldquo;informing&rdquo;
and too little &ldquo;wild and strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later in the same chapter he describes how, before he was
four years old, near Hythe, in Kent, he saw in a penthouse against an
old village church, &ldquo;skulls of the old Danes&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Long ago&rsquo; (said the sexton, with Borrow&rsquo;s
aid), &lsquo;long ago they came pirating into these parts: and then
there chanced a mighty shipwreck, for God was angry with them, and He
sunk them; and their skulls, as they came ashore, were placed here as
a memorial.&nbsp; There were many more when I was young, but now they
are fast disappearing.&nbsp; Some of them must have belonged to strange
fellows, madam.&nbsp; Only see that one; why, the two young gentry can
scarcely lift it!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, my brother and myself had
entered the Golgotha, and commenced handling these grim relics of mortality.&nbsp;
One enormous skull, lying in a corner, had fixed our attention, and
we had drawn it forth.&nbsp; Spirit of eld, what a skull was yon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still seem to see it, the huge grim thing; many of the others
were large, strikingly so, and appeared fully to justify the old man&rsquo;s
conclusion that their owners must have been strange fellows; but compared
with this mighty mass of bone they looked small and diminutive, like
those of pigmies; it must have belonged to a giant, one of those <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>red-haired
warriors of whose strength and stature such wondrous tales are told
in the ancient chronicles of the north, and whose grave-hills, when
ransacked, occasionally reveal secrets which fill the minds of puny
moderns with astonishment and awe.&nbsp; Reader, have you ever pored
days and nights over the pages of Snorro? probably not, for he wrote
in a language which few of the present day understand, and few would
be tempted to read him tamed down by Latin dragomans.&nbsp; A brave
old book is that of Snorro, containing the histories and adventures
of old northern kings and champions, who seemed to have been quite different
men, if we may judge from the feats which they performed, from those
of these days.&nbsp; One of the best of his histories is that which
describes the life of Harald Haardraade, who, after manifold adventures
by land and sea, now a pirate, now a mercenary of the Greek emperor,
became King of Norway, and eventually perished at the battle of Stanford
Bridge, whilst engaged in a gallant onslaught upon England.&nbsp; Now,
I have often thought that the old Kemp, whose mouldering skull in the
Golgotha at Hythe my brother and myself could scarcely lift, must have
resembled in one respect at least this Harald, whom Snorro describes
as a great and wise ruler and a determined leader, dangerous in battle,
of fair presence, and measuring in height just <i>five ells</i>, neither
more nor less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this incident he says he need offer no apology for relating it
&ldquo;as it subsequently exercised considerable influence over his
pursuits,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, his study of Danish literature; but in
the proof he added also that the incident, &ldquo;perhaps more than
anything else, tended to bring my imaginative powers into action&rdquo;&mdash;this
he cut out, though the skulls may have impressed him as the skeleton
disinterred by a horse impressed Richard Jefferies and haunted him in
his &ldquo;Gamekeeper,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meadow Thoughts,&rdquo; and elsewhere.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Sometimes
he modified a showy phrase, and &ldquo;when I became ambitious of the
title of Lavengro and strove to deserve it&rdquo; was cut down to &ldquo;when
I became a student.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he wrote of Cowper in the third
chapter he said, to justify Cowper&rsquo;s melancholy, that &ldquo;Providence,
whose ways are not our ways, interposed, and with the withering blasts
of misery nipped that which otherwise might have terminated in fruit,
noxious and lamentable&rdquo;; but he substituted a mere &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;
for the words about Providence.&nbsp; In the description of young Jasper
he changed his &ldquo;short arms like&rdquo; his father, into &ldquo;long
arms unlike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fourteenth chapter Borrow describes his father&rsquo;s retirement
from the army after Waterloo, and his settling down at Norwich, so poor
as to be anxious for his children&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; He speaks of
poor officers who &ldquo;had slight influence with the great who gave
themselves very little trouble either about them or their families.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Originally he went on thus, but cut out the words from the proof:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I have reason for concluding that they were not altogether
overlooked by a certain power still higher than even the aristocracy
of England and with yet more extensive influence in the affairs of the
world.&nbsp; I allude to Providence, which, it is said, never forsakes
those who trust in it, as I suppose these old soldiers did, for I have
known many instances in which their children have contrived to make
their way gallantly in the world, unaided by the patronage of the great,
whilst others who were possessed of it were most miserably shipwrecked,
being suddenly overset by some unexpected squall, against which it could
avail them nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This change is a relief to the style.&nbsp; The next which I shall
quote is something more than that.&nbsp; It shows Borrow constructing
the conversation of his father and mother when they were considering
his prospects at the age of twelve.&nbsp; His father was complaining
of the boy&rsquo;s Gypsy <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>look,
and of his ways and manners, and of the strange company he kept in Ireland&mdash;&ldquo;people
of evil report, of whom terrible things were said&mdash;horse-witches
and the like.&rdquo;&nbsp; His mother made the excuse: &ldquo;But he
thinks of other things now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Other languages, you
mean,&rdquo; said his father.&nbsp; But in the proof his mother adds
to her speech, &ldquo;He is no longer in Ireland,&rdquo; and the father
takes her up with, &ldquo;So much the better for him; yet should he
ever fall into evil practices, I shall always lay it to the account
of that melancholy sojourn in Ireland and the acquaintances he formed
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of putting into his friend, the Anglo-Germanist Williams
Taylor&rsquo;s mouth, the opinion &ldquo;that as we are aware that others
frequently misinterpret us, we are equally liable to fall into the same
error with respect to them,&rdquo; he alters it to the very different
one, &ldquo;That there is always some eye upon us; and that it is impossible
to keep anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be divulged
by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the twenty-fourth chapter Borrow makes Thurtell, the friend of
bruisers, hint, with unconscious tragic irony, at his famous end&mdash;by
dying upon the gallows for the murder of Mr. William Weare.&nbsp; He
tells the magistrate whom he has asked to lend him a piece of land for
a prize-fight that his own name is no matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;a time may come&mdash;we
are not yet buried&mdash;whensoever my hour arrives, I hope I shall
prove myself equal to my destiny, however high&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like bird that&rsquo;s bred amongst the Helicons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original Thurtell&rsquo;s quotation was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No poor unminded outlaw sneaking home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter now ends with the magistrate&rsquo;s question to young
Borrow about this man: &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
manuscript Borrow answered, &ldquo;John Thurtell.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>The
proof had, &ldquo;John . . .&rdquo; Borrow hesitated, and in the margin,
having crossed out &ldquo;John,&rdquo; he put the initial &ldquo;J&rdquo;
as a substitute, but finally crossed that out also.&nbsp; He was afraid
of names which other people might know and regard in a different way.&nbsp;
Thus in the same proof he altered &ldquo;the philologist Scaliger&rdquo;
to &ldquo;a certain philologist&rdquo;: thus, too, he would not write
down the name of Dereham, but kept on calling it &ldquo;pretty D---&rdquo;;
and when he had to refer to Cowper as buried in Dereham Church he spoke

most pious bard.&rdquo;</p>

IV&mdash;WHAT IS TRUTH?</h2>
<p>These changes in the proof of what was afterwards called &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
were, it need hardly be said, made in order to bring the words nearer
to a representation of the idea in Borrow&rsquo;s brain, and nearer
to a perfect harmony with one another.&nbsp; Take the case of Jasper
Petulengro&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Borrow knew the man Ambrose Smith well
enough to know whether he had a long or a short arm: for did not Jasper
say to him when he was dismal, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll now go to the tents
and put on the gloves, and I&rsquo;ll try to make you feel what a sweet
thing it is to be alive, brother!&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly he had a short
arm like his father, but in reading the proof it must somehow have seemed
to Borrow that his Jasper Petulengro&mdash;founded on Ambrose Smith
and at many points resembling him&mdash;ought to have a long arm.&nbsp;
The short arm was true to &ldquo;the facts&rdquo;; the long arm was
more impressive and was truer to the created character, which was more
important.</p>
<p>It was hardly these little things that kept Borrow working at &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
for nearly half of his fourth decade and a full half of his fifth.&nbsp;
But these little things were part of the great difficulty of making
an harmonious whole by changing, cutting out and inserting.&nbsp; When
Ford and John Murray&rsquo;s reader asked him for his life they probably
meant a plain statement of a few &ldquo;important facts,&rdquo; such
facts as there could hardly be two opinions about, such facts as fill
the ordinary biography or &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
knew well enough that these facts either produce no effect in the reader&rsquo;s
mind or they produce one effect here <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and
a different one there, since the dullest mind cannot blankly receive
a dead statement without some effort to give it life.&nbsp; Borrow was
not going to commit himself to incontrovertible statements such as are
or might be made to a Life Insurance Company.&nbsp; He had no command
of a tombstone style and would not have himself circumscribed with full
Christian name, date of birth, etc., as a sexton or parish clerk might
have done for him.&nbsp; Twenty years later indeed&mdash;in 1862&mdash;he
did write such an account of himself to be printed as part of an appendix
to a history of his old school at Norwich.&nbsp; It is full of dates,
but they are often inaccurate, and the years 1825 to 1833 he fills with
&ldquo;a life of roving adventures.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cannot refrain from
calling himself a great rider, walker and swimmer, or from telling the
story of how he walked from Norwich to London&mdash;he calls it London
to Norwich&mdash;in twenty-seven hours.&nbsp; But in 1862 he could rely
on &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;; he was an
author at the end of his career, and he had written himself down to
the best of his genius.&nbsp; The case was different in 1842.</p>
<p>He saw himself as a man variously and mysteriously alive, very different
from every other man and especially from certain kinds of man.&nbsp;
When you look at a larch wood with a floor of fern in October at the
end of twilight, you are not content to have that wood described as
so many hundred poles growing on three acres of land, the property of
a manufacturer of gin.&nbsp; Still less was Borrow content to sit down
at Oulton, while the blast howled amid the pines which nearly surround
his lonely dwelling, and answer the genial Ford&rsquo;s questions one
by one: &ldquo;What countries have you been in?&nbsp; What languages
do you understand?&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; Ford probably divined a book
as substantial and well-furnished with milestones as &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain,&rdquo; and he cheerfully told Borrow to make the broth &ldquo;thick
and slab.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Ford,
in fact, doubled the difficulty.&nbsp; Not only did Borrow feel that
his book must create a living soul, but the soul must be heroic to meet
the expectations of Ford and the public.&nbsp; The equestrian group
had been easy enough&mdash;himself mounted on Sidi Habismilk, with the
swift Jew and the Gypsy at his side&mdash;but the life of a man was
a different matter.&nbsp; Nor was the task eased by his exceptional
memory.&nbsp; He claimed, as has been seen, to remember the look of
the viper seen in his third year.&nbsp; Later, in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
he meets a tinker and buys his stock-in-trade to set himself up with.&nbsp;
The tinker tries to put him off by tales of the Blazing Tinman who has
driven him from his beat.&nbsp; Borrow answers that he can manage the
Tinman one way or other, saying, &ldquo;I know all kinds of strange
words and names, and, as I told you before, I sometimes hit people when
they put me out.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last the tinker consents to sell his
pony and things on one condition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s
my name,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t, may I&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow answers: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, it&rsquo;s a bad habit, neither
pleasant nor profitable.&nbsp; Your name is Slingsby&mdash;Jack Slingsby.&nbsp;
There, don&rsquo;t stare, there&rsquo;s nothing in my telling you your
name: I&rsquo;ve been in these parts before, at least not very far from
here.&nbsp; Ten years ago, when I was little more than a child, I was
about twenty miles from here in a post chaise, at the door of an inn,
and as I looked from the window of the chaise, I saw you standing by
a gutter, with a big tin ladle in your hand, and somebody called you
Jack Slingsby.&nbsp; I never forget anything I hear or see; I can&rsquo;t,
I wish I could.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s nothing strange in my knowing
your name; indeed there&rsquo;s nothing strange in anything, provided
you examine it to the bottom.&nbsp; Now what am I to give you for the
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I once heard a Gypsy give a similar and equal display of memory.)&nbsp;
Dr. Knapp has corroborated several details of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
which confirm Borrow&rsquo;s opinion of his <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>memory.&nbsp;
Hearing the author whom he met on his walk beyond Salisbury, speak of
the &ldquo;wine of 1811, the comet year,&rdquo; Borrow said that he
remembered being in the market-place of Dereham, looking at that comet.
<a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30">{30}</a>&nbsp; Dr Knapp
first makes sure exactly when Borrow was at Dereham in 1811 and then
that there was a comet visible during that time.&nbsp; He proves also
from newspapers of 1820 that the fight, in the twenty sixth chapter
of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; ended in a thunderstorm like that described
by Borrow and used by Petulengro to forecast the violent end of Thurtell.</p>
<p>Now a brute memory like that, which cannot be gainsaid, is not an
entirely good servant to a man who will not put down everything he can,
like a boy at an examination.&nbsp; The ordinary man probably recalls
all that is of importance in his past life, though he may not like to
think so, but a man with a memory like Borrow&rsquo;s or with a supply
of diaries like Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff&rsquo;s may well ask, &ldquo;What
is truth?&rdquo; as Borrow often did.&nbsp; The facts may convey a false
impression which an omission or a positive &ldquo;lie&rdquo; may correct.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Just at first, as has been seen, a month after his Christmas wine
with Mr Petulengro, Borrow saw his life as a drama, perhaps as a melodrama,
full of Gypsies, jockeys and horses, wild men of many lands and several
murderers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Capital subject,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; That
was when he saw himself as an adventurer and Europe craning its neck
to keep him in sight.&nbsp; But he knew well, and after the first flush
he remembered, that he was not merely a robust walker, rider and philologist.&nbsp;
When he was only eighteen he was continually asking himself &ldquo;What
is truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;involved
myself imperceptibly in a dreary labyrinth of doubt, and, whichever
way I turned, no reasonable prospect of extricating myself appeared.&nbsp;
The means <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>by
which I had brought myself into this situation may be very briefly told;
I had inquired into many matters, in order that I might become wise,
and I had read and pondered over the words of the wise, so called, till
I had made myself master of the sum of human wisdom; namely, that everything
is enigmatical and that man is an enigma to himself; thence the cry
of &lsquo;What is truth?&rsquo;&nbsp; I had ceased to believe in the
truth of that in which I had hitherto trusted, and yet could find nothing
in which I could put any fixed or deliberate belief.&nbsp; I was, indeed,
in a labyrinth!&nbsp; In what did I not doubt?&nbsp; With respect to
crime and virtue I was in doubt; I doubted that the one was blameable
and the other praiseworthy.&nbsp; Are not all things subjected to the
law of necessity?&nbsp; Assuredly; time and chance govern all things:
yet how can this be? alas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was myself; for what was I born?&nbsp; Are not
all things born to be forgotten?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s incomprehensible:
yet is it not so?&nbsp; Those butterflies fall and are forgotten.&nbsp;
In what is man better than a butterfly?&nbsp; All then is born to be
forgotten.&nbsp; Ah! that was a pang indeed; &rsquo;tis at such a moment
that a man wishes to die.&nbsp; The wise king of Jerusalem, who sat
in his shady arbours beside his sunny fishpools, saying so many fine
things, wished to die, when he saw that not only all was vanity, but
that he himself was vanity.&nbsp; Will a time come when all will be
forgotten that now is beneath the sun?&nbsp; If so, of what profit is
life? . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would I had never been born!&rsquo;&nbsp; I said to
myself; and a thought would occasionally intrude.&nbsp; But was I ever
born?&nbsp; Is not all that I see a lie&mdash;a deceitful phantom?&nbsp;
Is there a world, and earth, and sky? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he no longer articulated these doubts he was still not as sure
of himself as Ford imagined.&nbsp; He was, by the way, seldom sure of
his own age, and Dr. Knapp <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31">{31}</a>
gives <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>four
instances of his underestimating it by two and even five years.&nbsp;
Whatever may be the explanation of this, after three years&rsquo; work
at &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; he &ldquo;will not be hurried for anyone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was probably finding that, with no notebooks or letters to help,
the work was very different from the writing of &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain,&rdquo; which was pieced together out of long letters to the Bible
Society, and, moreover, was written within a few years of the events
described.&nbsp; The events of his childhood and youth had retired into
a perspective that was beyond his control: he would often be tempted
to change their perspective, to bring forward some things, to set back
others.&nbsp; In any case these things were no longer mere solid material
facts.&nbsp; They were living a silent life of spirits within his brain.&nbsp;
He took to calling the book his &ldquo;life&rdquo; or &ldquo;autobiography,&rdquo;
not &ldquo;Life: a Drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was advertised as such; but
he would not have it.&nbsp; At the last moment he refused to label it
an autobiography, because he knew that it was inadequate, and that in
any case other men would not understand or would misunderstand it.&nbsp;
He must have felt certain that the fair figure of &ldquo;Don Jorge,&rdquo;
created in &ldquo;The Bible of Spain,&rdquo; had been poisoned for most
readers by many a passage in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; like that where
he doubted the existence of self and sky and stars, or where he told
of the breakdown in his health when he was sixteen and of the gloom
that followed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how much more quickly does strength desert the human frame
than return to it!&nbsp; I had become convalescent, it is true, but
my state of feebleness was truly pitiable.&nbsp; I believe it is in
that state that the most remarkable feature of human physiology frequently
exhibits itself.&nbsp; Oh, how dare I mention the dark feeling of mysterious
dread which comes over the mind, and which the lamp of reason, though
burning bright the while, is unable to dispel!&nbsp; Art thou, as leeches
say, the concomitant of disease&mdash;the result of <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>shattered
nerves?&nbsp; Nay, rather the principle of woe itself, the fountain
head of all sorrow co-existent with man, whose influence he feels when
yet unborn, and whose workings he testifies with his earliest cries,
when, &lsquo;drowned in tears,&rsquo; he first beholds the light; for,
as the sparks fly upward, so is man born to trouble, and woe doth he
bring with him into the world, even thyself, dark one, terrible one,
causeless, unbegotten, without a father.&nbsp; Oh, how frequently dost
thou break down the barriers which divide thee from the poor soul of
man, and overcast its sunshine with thy gloomy shadow.&nbsp; In the
brightest days of prosperity&mdash;in the midst of health and wealth&mdash;how
sentient is the poor human creature of thy neighbourhood! how instinctively
aware that the floodgates of horror may be cast open, and the dark stream
engulf him for ever and ever!&nbsp; Then is it not lawful for man to
exclaim, &lsquo;Better that I had never been born!&rsquo;&nbsp; Fool,
for thyself thou wast not born, but to fulfil the inscrutable decrees
of thy Creator; and how dost thou know that this dark principle is not,
after all, thy best friend; that it is not that which tempers the whole
mass of thy corruption?&nbsp; It may be, for what thou knowest, the
mother of wisdom, and of the great works: it is the dread of the horror
of the night that makes the pilgrim hasten on his way.&nbsp; When thou
feelest it nigh, let thy safety word be &lsquo;Onward&rsquo;; if thou
tarry, thou art overwhelmed.&nbsp; Courage! build great works&mdash;&rsquo;tis
urging thee&mdash;it is ever nearest the favourites of God&mdash;the
fool knows little of it.&nbsp; Thou wouldst be joyous, wouldst thou?
then be a fool.&nbsp; What great work was ever the result of joy, the
puny one?&nbsp; Who have been the wise ones, the mighty ones, the conquering
ones of this earth? the joyous?&nbsp; I believe not.&nbsp; The fool
is happy, or comparatively so&mdash;certainly the least sorrowful, but
he is still a fool; and whose notes are sweetest, those of the nightingale,
or of the silly lark?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;What
ails you, my child?&rsquo; said a mother to her son, as he lay on a
couch under the influence of the dreadful one; &lsquo;what ails you?
you seem afraid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boy</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mother</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;But of what? there is no one can
harm you; of what are you apprehensive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boy</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Of nothing that I can express; I
know not what I am afraid of, but afraid I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mother</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps you see sights and visions;
I knew a lady once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed
man threaten her, but it was only an imagination, a phantom of the brain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boy</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;No armed man threatens me; and &rsquo;tis
not a thing that would cause me any fear.&nbsp; Did an armed man threaten
me, I would get up and fight him; weak as I am, I would wish for nothing
better, for then, perhaps, I should lose this fear; mine is a dread
of I know not what, and there the horror lies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mother</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Your forehead is cool, and your
speech collected.&nbsp; Do you know where you are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boy</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;I know where I am, and I see things
just as they are; you are beside me, and upon the table there is a book
which was written by a Florentine; all this I see, and that there is
no ground for being afraid.&nbsp; I am, moreover, quite cool, and feel
no pain&mdash;but, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there was a burst of &lsquo;gemiti, sospiri ed alti
guai.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas, alas, poor child of clay! as the sparks fly
upward, so wast thou born to sorrow&mdash;Onward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if men passed over this as a youthful distemper, rather often
recurring, what would they make of his saying that &ldquo;Fame after
death is better than the top of fashion in life&rdquo;?&nbsp; Would
they not accuse him of entertaining them, as he did his companion and
half-sweetheart of the dingle, Isopel Berners, &ldquo;with strange dreams
of adventure, in which he figures in opaque forests, strangling wild
beasts, <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>or
discovering and plundering the hordes of dragons; and sometimes . .
. other things far more genuine&mdash;how he had tamed savage mares,
wrestled with Satan, and had dealings with ferocious publishers&rdquo;?</p>
<p>He did not simplify the matter by his preface.&nbsp; There he announced
that the book was &ldquo;a dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, he said, endeavoured
to describe a dream, partly of adventure, in which will be found copious
notices of books and many descriptions of life and manners, some in
a very unusual form.&nbsp; A dream containing &ldquo;copious notices
of books&rdquo;!&nbsp; A dream in three volumes and over a thousand
pages!&nbsp; A dream which he had &ldquo;endeavoured to describe&rdquo;!&nbsp;
From these three words it was necessary to suppose that it was a real
dream, not a narrative introduced by the machinery of a dream, like
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dream of Fair
Women.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was.&nbsp; The book was not an autobiography
but a representation of a man&rsquo;s life in the backward dream of
memory.&nbsp; He had refused to drag the events of his life out of the
spirit land, to turn them into a narrative on the same plane as a newspaper,
leaving readers to convert them back again into reality or not, according
to their choice or ability.&nbsp; His life seemed to him a dream, not
a newspaper obituary, not an equestrian statue on a pedestal in Albemarle
Street opposite John Murray&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The result was that &ldquo;the long-talked-of autobiography&rdquo;
disappointed those who expected more than a collection of bold picaresque
sketches.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; complained the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo;
&ldquo;an autobiography, even with the licence of fiction;&rdquo; &ldquo;the
interest of autobiography is lost,&rdquo; and as a work of fiction it
is a failure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; said that
it was &ldquo;for ever hovering between Romance and Reality, and the
whole tone of the narrative inspires profound distrust.&nbsp; Nay, more,
it will make us disbelieve the tales in &lsquo;The Zincali&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Bible in Spain.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Another
critic found &ldquo;a false dream in the place of reality, a shadowy
nothing in the place of that something all who had read &lsquo;The Bible
in Spain&rsquo; craved and hoped for from his pen.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
friend, William Bodham Donne, in &ldquo;Tait&rsquo;s Edinburgh Magazine,&rdquo;
explained how &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was &ldquo;not exactly what the
public had been expecting.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another friend, Whitwell Elwin,
in the &ldquo;Quarterly Review,&rdquo; reviewing &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and its continuation, &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; not only praised
the truth and vividness of the descriptions, but said that &ldquo;various
portions of the history are known to be a faithful narrative of Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s career, while we ourselves can testify, as to many other
parts of his volumes, that nothing can excel the fidelity with which
he has described both men and things,&rdquo; and &ldquo;why under these
circumstances he should envelop the question in mystery is more than
we can divine.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the larger part, and
possibly the whole, of the work is a narrative of actual occurrences,
and just as little that it would gain immensely by a plain avowal of
the fact.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have suggested that there were good reasons
for not calling the work an autobiography.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp has shown
in his fortieth chapter that the narrative was interrupted to admit
lengthy references to much later events for purposes of &ldquo;occult
vengeance&rdquo;; and that these interruptions helped to cause the delay
and to change the title there can be little doubt.</p>
<p>Borrow was angry at the failure of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and in
the appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; he actually said that he
had never called &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; an autobiography and never authorised
anyone to call it such.&nbsp; This was not a lie but a somewhat frantic
assertion that his critics were mistaken about his &ldquo;dream.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In later years he quietly admitted that &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; gave
an account of his early life.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Yet
Dr. Knapp was not strictly and completely accurate in saying that the
first volume of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is &ldquo;strictly autobiographical
and authentic as the whole was at first intended to be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He could give no proof that Borrow&rsquo;s memory went back to his third
year or that he first handled a viper at that time.&nbsp; He could only
show that Borrow&rsquo;s accounts do not conflict with other accounts
of the same matters.&nbsp; When they did conflict, Dr. Knapp was unduly
elated by the discovery.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the sixteenth chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
where he describes the horse fair at Norwich when he was a boy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reader is already aware that I had long since conceived
a passion for the equine race, a passion in which circumstances had
of late not permitted me to indulge.&nbsp; I had no horses to ride,
but I took pleasure in looking at them; and I had already attended more
than one of these fairs: the present was lively enough, indeed horse
fairs are seldom dull.&nbsp; There was shouting and whooping, neighing
and braying; there was galloping and trotting; fellows with highlows
and white stockings, and with many a string dangling from the knees
of their tight breeches, were running desperately, holding horses by
the halter, and in some cases dragging them along; there were long-tailed
steeds, and dock-tailed steeds of every degree and breed; there were
droves of wild ponies, and long rows of sober cart horses; there were
donkeys and even mules: the last rare things to be seen in damp, misty
England, for the mule pines in mud and rain, and thrives best with a
hot sun above and a burning sand below.&nbsp; There were&mdash;oh, the
gallant creatures!&nbsp; I hear their neigh upon the wind; there were&mdash;goodliest
sight of all&mdash;certain enormous quadrupeds only seen to perfection
in our native isle, led about by dapper grooms, their manes ribanded
and their tails <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>curiously
clubbed and balled.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&mdash;how distinctly do they say,
ha! ha!</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man draws nigh, he is mounted on a lean pony, and he
leads by the bridle one of these animals; nothing very remarkable about
that creature, unless in being smaller than the rest and gentle, which
they are not; he is not of the sightliest look; he is almost dun, and
over one eye a thick film has gathered.&nbsp; But stay! there <i>is</i>
something remarkable about that horse, there is something in his action
in which he differs from all the rest: as he advances, the clamour is
hushed! all eyes are turned upon him&mdash;what looks of interest&mdash;of
respect&mdash;and, what is this? people are taking off their hats&mdash;surely
not to that steed!&nbsp; Yes, verily! men, especially old men, are taking
off their hats to that one-eyed steed, and I hear more than one deep-drawn
ah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What horse is that?&rsquo; said I to a very old fellow,
the counterpart of the old man on the pony, save that the last wore
a faded suit of velveteen, and this one was dressed in a white frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The best in mother England,&rsquo; said the very old
man, taking a knobbed stick from his mouth, and looking me in the face,
at first carelessly, but presently with something like interest; &lsquo;he
is old like myself, but can still trot his twenty miles an hour.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t live long, my swain; tall and overgrown ones like thee
never does; yet, if you should chance to reach my years, you may boast
to thy great grand boys, thou hast seen Marshland Shales.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amain I did for the horse what I would neither do for earl
or baron, doffed my hat; yes!&nbsp; I doffed my hat to the wondrous
horse, the fast trotter, the best in mother England; and I, too, drew
a deep ah! and repeated the words of the old fellows around.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such
a horse as this we shall never see again, a pity that he is so old.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>But
Dr. Knapp informs us that the well-known trotting stallion, Marshland
Shales, was not offered for sale by auction until 1827, when he was
twenty-five years old, and ten years after the date implied in &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And what is more, Dr. Knapp concludes that Borrow must have been in
Norwich in 1827, on the fair day, April 12.</p>
<h2><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>CHAPTER
V&mdash;HIS PREDECESSORS</h2>
<p>I do not wish to make Borrow out a suffering innocent in the hands
of that learned heavy-weight and wag, Dr. Knapp.&nbsp; Borrow was a
writing man; he was sometimes a friend of jockeys, of Gypsies and of
pugilists, but he was always a writing man; and the writer who is delighted
to have his travels in Spain compared with the rogue romance, &ldquo;Gil
Blas,&rdquo; is no innocent.&nbsp; Photography, it must be remembered,
was not invented.&nbsp; It was not in those days thought possible to
get life on to the paper by copying it with ink.&nbsp; Words could not
be the equivalents of acts.&nbsp; Life itself is fleeting, but words
remain and are put to our account.&nbsp; Every action, it is true, is
as old as man and never perishes without an heir.&nbsp; But so are words
as old as man, and they are conservative and stern in their treatment
of transitory life.&nbsp; Every action seems new and unique to the doer,
but how rarely does it seem so when it is recorded in words, how rarely
perhaps it is possible for it to seem so.&nbsp; A new form of literature
cannot be invented to match the most grand or most lovely life.&nbsp;
And fortunately; for if it could, one more proof of the ancient lineage
of our life would have been lost.&nbsp; Borrow did not sacrifice the
proof.&nbsp; He had read many books in many languages, and he had a
strong taste.&nbsp; He liked &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; which is a simple
chain of various and surprising adventures.&nbsp; He liked the lives
of criminals in the &ldquo;Newgate Lives and Trials&rdquo; (or rather
&ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo; 1825), which he compiled for a publisher
in his youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What struck me most,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with respect to
these lives was the art which the writers, whoever they were, possessed
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>of
telling a plain story.&nbsp; It is no easy thing to tell a story plainly
and distinctly by mouth; but to tell one on paper is difficult indeed,
so many snares lie in the way.&nbsp; People are afraid to put down what
is common on paper, they seek to embellish their narrative, as they
think, by philosophic speculations and reflections; they are anxious
to shine, and people who are anxious to shine, can never tell a plain
story.&nbsp; &lsquo;So I went with them to a music booth, where they
made me almost drunk with gin, and began to talk their flash language,
which I did not understand,&rsquo; says, or is made to say, Henry Simms,
executed at Tyburn some seventy years before the time of which I am
speaking.&nbsp; I have always looked upon this sentence as a masterpiece
of the narrative style, it is so concise and yet so very clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow read Bunyan, Sterne and Smollett: he liked Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe
Harold&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte&rdquo;;&mdash;he
liked that portrait with all Europe and all history for a background.&nbsp;
Above all, he read Defoe, and in the third chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
he has described his first sight of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; as
a little child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first object on which my eyes rested was a picture; it
was exceedingly well executed, at least the scene which it represented
made a vivid impression upon me, which would hardly have been the case
had the artist not been faithful to nature.&nbsp; A wild scene it was&mdash;a
heavy sea and rocky shore, with mountains in the background, above which
the moon was peering.&nbsp; Not far from the shore, upon the water,
was a boat with two figures in it, one of which stood at the bow, pointing
with what I knew to be a gun at a dreadful shape in the water; fire
was flashing from the muzzle of the gun, and the monster appeared to
be transfixed.&nbsp; I almost thought I heard its cry.&nbsp; I remained
motionless, gazing upon the picture, scarcely daring to draw my breath,
lest the new and wondrous world should vanish of which I had now obtained
a glimpse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>are
those people, and what could have brought them into that strange situation?&rsquo;
I asked myself; and now the seed of curiosity, which had so long lain
dormant, began to expand, and I vowed to myself to become speedily acquainted
with the whole history of the people in the boat.&nbsp; After looking
on the picture till every mark and line in it were familiar to me, I
turned over various leaves till I came to another engraving; a new source
of wonder&mdash;a low sandy beach on which the furious sea was breaking
in mountain-like billows; cloud and rack deformed the firmament, which
wore a dull and leaden-like hue; gulls and other aquatic fowls were
toppling upon the blast, or skimming over the tops of the maddening
waves&mdash;&lsquo;Mercy upon him! he must be drowned!&rsquo; I exclaimed,
as my eyes fell upon a poor wretch who appeared to be striving to reach
the shore; he was upon his legs, but was evidently half smothered with
the brine; high above his head curled a horrible billow, as if to engulf
him for ever.&nbsp; &lsquo;He must be drowned! he must be drowned!&rsquo;
I almost shrieked, and dropped the book.&nbsp; I soon snatched it up
again, and now my eye lighted on a third picture; again a shore, but
what a sweet and lovely one, and how I wished to be treading it; there
were beautiful shells lying on the smooth white sand, some were empty
like those I had occasionally seen on marble mantelpieces, but out of
others peered the heads and bodies of wondrous crayfish; a wood of thick
green trees skirted the beach and partly shaded it from the rays of
the sun, which shone hot above, while blue waves slightly crested with
foam were gently curling against it; there was a human figure upon the
beach, wild and uncouth, clad in the skins of animals, with a huge cap
on his head, a hatchet at his girdle, and in his hand a gun; his feet
and legs were bare; he stood in an attitude of horror and surprise;
his body was bent far back, and his eyes, which seemed starting out
of his head, were fixed <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>upon
a mark on the sand&mdash;a large distinct mark&mdash;a human footprint!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reader, is it necessary to name the book which now stood open
in my hand, and whose very prints, feeble expounders of its wondrous
lines, had produced within me emotions strange and novel?&nbsp; Scarcely,
for it was a book which has exerted over the minds of Englishmen an
influence certainly greater than any other of modern times, which has
been in most people&rsquo;s hands, and with the contents of which even
those who cannot read are to a certain extent acquainted; a book from
which the most luxuriant and fertile of our modern prose writers have
drunk inspiration; a book, moreover, to which, from the hardy deeds
which it narrates, and the spirit of strange and romantic enterprise
which it tends to awaken, England owes many of her astonishing discoveries
both by sea and land, and no inconsiderable part of her naval glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, spirit of De Foe!&nbsp; What does not my own
poor self owe to thee?&nbsp; England has better bards than either Greece
or Rome, yet I could spare them easier far than De Foe, &lsquo;unabashed
De Foe,&rsquo; as the hunchbacked rhymer styled him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in this manner, he declares, that he &ldquo;first took to
the paths of knowledge,&rdquo; and when he began his own &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo;
he must have well remembered the opening of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;I
was born in the year 1632, in the City of York, of a good family, though
not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, named Kreutznaer,
who first settled at Hull,&rdquo; though Borrow himself would have written
it: &ldquo;I was born in the year 16---, in the City of Y---, of a good
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen,
named Kruschen, who first settled at H---.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably he
remembered also that other fictitious autobiography of Defoe&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;The Adventures of Captain Singleton,&rdquo; of the child who
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>was
stolen and disposed of to a Gypsy and lived with his good Gypsy mother
until she happened to be hanged, a little too soon for him to be &ldquo;perfected
in the strolling trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Defoe had told him long before
Richard Ford that he need not be afraid of being low.&nbsp; He could
always give the same excuse as Defoe in &ldquo;Moll Flanders&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;as
the best use is to be made even of the worst story, the moral, &rsquo;tis
hoped, will keep the reader serious, even where the story might incline
him to be otherwise.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, Borrow did afterwards claim
that his book set forth in as striking a way as any &ldquo;the kindness
and providence of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even so, De Quincey suggested as
an excuse in his &ldquo;Confessions&rdquo; the service possibly to be
rendered to other opium-eaters.&nbsp; Borrow tells us in the twenty-second
chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; how he sought for other books of adventure
like &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo;&mdash;which he will not mention by
name!&mdash;and how he read many &ldquo;books of singular power, but
of coarse and prurient imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these, &ldquo;The
English Rogue,&rdquo; he describes as a book &ldquo;written by a remarkable
genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might have remembered in its preface the author
lamenting that, though it was meant for the life of a &ldquo;witty extravagant,&rdquo;
readers would regard it as the author&rsquo;s own life, &ldquo;and notwithstanding
all that hath been said to the contrary many still continue in this
belief.&rdquo;&nbsp; He might also have remembered that the apology
for portraying so much vice was that the ugliness of it&mdash;&ldquo;her
<i>vizard-mask</i> being remov&rsquo;d&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;cannot but
cause in her (<i>quondam</i>) adorers, a <i>loathing</i> instead of
<i>loving</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dirty hero runs away as a boy and on
the very first day tires of nuts and blackberries and longs &ldquo;to
taste of the <i>fleshpots</i> again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sleeps in a barn
until he is waked, pursued and caught by Gypsies.&nbsp; He agrees to
stay with them, and they have a debauch of eating, drinking and fornication,
which makes him well content to join the &ldquo;Ragged Regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They colour his face with walnut <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>juice
so that he looks a &ldquo;true son of an Egyptian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hundreds
of pages are filled thereafter by tediously dragging in, mostly from
other books, joyless and leering adventures of low dishonesty and low
lust.&nbsp; Another book of the kind which Borrow knew was the life
of Bamfylde Moore-Carew, born in 1693 at a Devonshire rectory.&nbsp;
He hunted the deer with some of his schoolfellows from Tiverton and
they played truant for fear of punishment.&nbsp; They fell in with some
Gypsies feasting and carousing and asked to be allowed to &ldquo;enlist
into their company.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gypsies admitted them after the
&ldquo;requisite ceremonies&rdquo; and &ldquo;proper oaths.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The philosophy of Carew or his historian is worth noticing.&nbsp; He
says of the Gypsies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are perhaps no people so completely happy as they are,
or enjoy so great a share of liberty.&nbsp; The king is elective by
the whole people, but none are allowed to stand as candidates for that
honour but such as have been long in their society, and perfectly studied
the nature and institution of it; they must likewise have given repeated
proofs of their personal wisdom, courage and capacity; this is better
known as they always keep a public record or register of all remarkable
(either good or bad) actions performed by any of their society, and
they can have no temptation to make choice of any but the most worthy,
as their king has no titles or legislative employments to bestow, which
might influence or corrupt their judgments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The laws of these people are few and simple, but most exactly
and punctually observed; the fundamental of which is that strong love
and mutual regard for each member in particular and for the whole community
in general, which is inculcated into them from the earliest infancy.
. . . Experience has shown them that, by keeping up their nice sense
of honour and shame, they are always enabled to keep their community
in better order <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>than
the most severe corporal punishments have been able to effect in other
governments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has still more tended to preserve their happiness
is that they know no other use of riches than the enjoyment of them.&nbsp;
They know no other use of it than that of promoting mirth and good humour;
for which end they generously bring their gains into a common stock,
whereby they whose gains are small have an equal enjoyment with those
whose profits are larger, excepting only that a mark or ignominy is
affixed on those who do not contribute to the common stock proportionately
to their abilities and the opportunities they have of gain, and this
is the source of their uninterrupted happiness; fully this means they
have no griping usurer to grind them, no lordly possessor to trample
on them, nor any envyings to torment them; they have no settled habitations,
but, like the Scythian of old, remove from place to place, as often
as their convenience or pleasure requires it, which render their life
a perpetual source of the greatest variety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what we have said above, and much more that we could add
of the happiness of these people and of their peculiar attachment to
each other, we may account for what has been matter of much surprise
to the friends of our hero, viz., his strong attachment, for the space
of about forty years, to this community, and his refusing the large
offers that have been made to quit their society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew himself met with nothing but success in his various impersonations
of Tom o&rsquo; Bedlam, a rat-catcher, a non-juring clergyman, a shipwrecked
Quaker, and an aged woman with three orphan grandchildren.&nbsp; He
was elected King of the Beggars, and lost the dignity only by deliberate
abdication.&nbsp; &ldquo;The restraints of a town not suiting him after
the free rambling life he had led, he took a house in the country, and
having acquired some property on the decease of a relation, he was in
a position to purchase a <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>residence
more suited to his taste, and lived for some years a quiet life &lsquo;respected
best by those who knew him best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very different literary hero of Borrow&rsquo;s was William Cobbett,
in spite of his radical opinions.&nbsp; Cobbett was a man who wrote,
as it were, with his fist, not the tips of his fingers.&nbsp; When I
begin to read him I think at once of a small country town where men
talk loudly to one another at a distance or as they walk along in opposite
directions, and the voices ring as their heels do on the cobbles.&nbsp;
He is not a man of arguments, but of convictions.&nbsp; He is so full
of convictions that, though not an indolent man, he has no time for
arguments.&nbsp; &ldquo;On this stiff ground,&rdquo; he says in North
Wiltshire, &ldquo;they grow a good many beans and give them to the pigs
with whey; which makes excellent pork for the <i>Londoners</i>; but
which must meet with a pretty hungry stomach to swallow it in Hampshire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When he was being shouted down at Lewes in 1822, and someone moved that
he should be put out of the room, he says: &ldquo;I rose that they might
see the man that they had to put out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hand that holds
the bridle holds the pen.&nbsp; The night after he has been hare-hunting&mdash;Friday,
November the sixteenth, 1821, at Old Hall, in Herefordshire&mdash;he
writes down this note of it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole day most delightfully passed a hare-hunting, with
a pretty pack of hounds kept here by Messrs. Palmer.&nbsp; They put
me upon a horse that seemed to have been made on purpose for me, strong,
tall, gentle and bold; and that carried me either over or through every
thing.&nbsp; I, who am just the weight of a four-bushel sack of good
wheat, actually sat on her back from daylight in the morning to dusk
(about nine hours) without once setting my foot on the ground.&nbsp;
Our ground was at Orcop, a place about four miles distance from this
place.&nbsp; We found a hare in a few minutes after throwing off; and,
in the course of the day, we had to find four, and were never more than
ten minutes <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in
finding.&nbsp; A steep and naked ridge, lying between two flat valleys,
having a mixture of pretty large fields and small woods, formed our
ground.&nbsp; The hares crossed the ridge forward and backward, and
gave us numerous views and very fine sport.&nbsp; I never rode on such
steep ground before; and, really, in going up and down some of the craggy
places, where the rain had washed the earth from the rocks, I did think,
once or twice of my neck, and how Sidmouth would like to see me.&nbsp;
As to the <i>cruelty</i>, as some pretend, of this sport, that point
I have, I think, settled, in one of the chapters of my &lsquo;Year&rsquo;s
Residence in America.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to the expense, a pack, even a
full pack of harriers, like this, costs less than two bottles of wine
a day with their inseparable concomitants.&nbsp; And as to the <i>time</i>
spent, hunting is inseparable from <i>early rising</i>; and, with habits
of early rising, who ever wanted time for any business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow could not resist this man&rsquo;s plain living and plain thinking,
or his sentences that are like acts&mdash;like blows or strides.&nbsp;
And if he had needed any encouragement in the expression of prejudices,
Cobbett offered it.&nbsp; The following, from &ldquo;Cottage Economy,&rdquo;
will serve as an example.&nbsp; It is from a chapter on &ldquo;Brewing&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The practice of tea drinking must render the frame feeble
and unfit to encounter hard labour or severe weather, while, as I have
shown, it deducts from the means of replenishing the belly and covering
the back.&nbsp; Hence succeeds a softness, an effeminacy, a seeking
for the fireside, a lurking in the bed, and, in short, all the characteristics
of idleness for which, in his case, real want of strength furnishes
an apology.&nbsp; The tea drinking fills the public-house, makes the
frequenting of it habitual, corrupts boys as soon as they are able to
move from home, and does little less for the girls, to whom the gossip
of the teatable is no bad preparatory school for the brothel.&nbsp;
At the very least, <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>it
teaches them idleness.&nbsp; The everlasting dawdling about with the
slops of the tea-tackle gives them a relish for nothing that requires
strength and activity.&nbsp; When they go from home, they know how to
do nothing that is useful, to brew, to bake, to make butter, to milk,
to rear poultry; to do any earthly thing of use they are wholly unqualified.&nbsp;
To shut poor young creatures up in manufactories is bad enough; but
there at any rate they do something that is useful; whereas the girl
that has been brought up merely to boil the teakettle, and to assist
in the gossip inseparable from the practice, is a mere consumer of food,
a pest to her employer, and a curse to her husband, if any man be so
unfortunate as to fix his affections upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it in the power of any man, any good labourer who has
attained the age of fifty, to look back upon the last thirty years of
his life, without cursing the day in which tea was introduced into England?&nbsp;
Where is there such a man who cannot trace to this cause a very considerable
part of all the mortifications and sufferings of his life?&nbsp; When
was he ever too late at his labour; when did he ever meet with a frown,
with a turning off and with pauperism on that account, without being
able to trace it to the teakettle?&nbsp; When reproached with lagging
in the morning, the poor wretch tells you that he will make up for it
by <i>working during his breakfast time</i>!&nbsp; I have heard this
a hundred and a hundred times over.&nbsp; He was up time enough; but
the teakettle kept him lolling and lounging at home; and now instead
of sitting down to a breakfast upon bread, bacon and beer, which is
to carry him on to the hour of dinner, he has to force his limbs along
under the sweat of feebleness, and at dinner-time to swallow his dry
bread, or slake his half-feverish thirst at the pump or the brook.&nbsp;
To the wretched teakettle he has to return at night with legs hardly
sufficient to maintain him; and then he makes his miserable progress
towards <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>that
death which he finds ten or fifteen years sooner than he would have
found it had he made his wife brew beer instead of making tea.&nbsp;
If he now and then gladdens his heart with the drugs of the public-house,
some quarrel, some accident, some illness is the probable consequence;
to the affray abroad succeeds an affray at home; the mischievous example
reaches the children, cramps them or scatters them, and misery for life
is the consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Cobbett wrote against tea so was
Borrow to write against the Pope.</p>
<p>Being a reading and a writing man who had set down all his most substantial
adventures in earlier books, Borrow, says Mr. Thomas Seccombe, had no
choice but &ldquo;to interpret autobiography as &lsquo;autobiographiction.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50">{50}</a>&nbsp; Parts
of the autobiography, he says, are &ldquo;as accurate and veracious
as John Wesley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Journal,&rsquo; but the way in which the
dingle ingredients&rdquo; [in the stories of Isopel Berners, the postillion,
and the Man in Black] &ldquo;are mingled, and the extent to which lies&mdash;damned
lies&mdash;or facts predominate, will always be a fascinating topic
for literary conjecture.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must not be forgotten, however,
that Borrow never called the published book his autobiography.&nbsp;
He did something like what I believe young writers often do; he described
events in his own life with modifications for the purpose of concealment
in some cases and of embellishment in others.&nbsp; If he had never
labelled it an autobiography there would have been no mystery, and the
conclusion of readers would be that most of it could not have been invented,
but that the postillion&rsquo;s story, for example, is a short story
written to embody some facts and some opinions, without any appearance
of being the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&nbsp; If Borrow
made a set of letters to the Bible Society into a book like &ldquo;Gil
Blas,&rdquo; he could hardly do <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>less&mdash;especially
when he had been reminded of the fact&mdash;with his remoter adventures;
and having taken out dates and names of persons and places he felt free.&nbsp;
He produced his view of himself, as De Quincey did in his &ldquo;Confessions
of an English Opium Eater.&rdquo;&nbsp; This view was modified by his
public reputation, by his too potent memory and the need for selection,
by his artistic sense, and by his literary training.&nbsp; So far from
suffering by the two elements, if they are to be separated, of fiction
and autobiography, &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;
gain immensely.&nbsp; The autobiographical form&mdash;the use of the
first person singular&mdash;is no mere device to attract an interest
and belief as in &ldquo;Captain Singleton&rdquo; and a thousand novels.&nbsp;
Again and again we are made perfectly certain that the man could not
have written otherwise.&nbsp; He is sounding his own depths, and out
of mere shyness, at times, uses the transparent amateur trick of pretending
that he was writing of someone else.&nbsp; Years afterwards, when Mr.
Watts-Dunton asked him, &ldquo;What is the real nature of autobiography?&rdquo;
he answered in questions: &ldquo;Is it a mere record of the incidents
of a man&rsquo;s life? or is it a picture of the man himself&mdash;his
character, his soul?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>CHAPTER
VI&mdash;THE BIOGRAPHER&rsquo;S MATERIAL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; give Borrow&rsquo;s
character and soul by direct and indirect means.&nbsp; Their truth and
fiction produce a consistent picture which we feel to be true.&nbsp;
Dr. Knapp has shown, where the facts are accessible, that Borrow does
not much neglect, mislay or pervert them.&nbsp; But neither Dr. Knapp
nor anyone else has captured facts which would be of any significance
had Borrow told us nothing himself.&nbsp; Some of the anecdotes lap
a branch here and there; some disclose a little rotten wood or fungus;
others show the might of a great limb, perhaps a knotty protuberance
with a grotesque likeness, or the height of the whole; others again
are like clumsy arrogant initials carved on the venerable bark.&nbsp;
I shall use some of them, but for the most part I shall use Borrow&rsquo;s
own brush both to portray and to correct.</p>
<h2><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>CHAPTER
VII&mdash;PORTRAITS OF THE ARTIST</h2>
<p>The five works of Borrow&rsquo;s maturity&mdash;from &ldquo;The Zincali:
or the Gypsies of Spain,&rdquo; written when he had turned thirty, to
&ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; written when he had turned fifty&mdash;have
this in common, and perhaps for their chief quality, that of set purpose
and by inevitable accident they reveal Borrow, the body and the spirit
of the man.&nbsp; Together they compose a portrait, if not a small gallery
of portraits.&nbsp; Of these the most deliberate is the one that emerges
from &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In these books, written after he had passed forty, he described the
first twenty-two years of his life, without, so far as is known, using
any notebooks or other contemporary documents.&nbsp; As I have said
before, the literal accuracy of such a description must have been limited
by his power and his willingness to see things as they were.&nbsp; In
some ways there is no greater stranger to the youth of twenty than the
man of forty who was once that youth, and if he overcomes that strangeness
it is often by the perilous process of concealing the strangeness and
the difference.&nbsp; The result is&mdash;or is it an individual misfortune
of mine?&mdash;that the figure of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; seems to me,
more often than not, and on the whole, to be nearer the age of forty
than of twenty.&nbsp; The artist, that is to say, dominates his subject,
the tall overgrown youth of twenty-two, as grey as a badger.&nbsp; It
is very different in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; where artist
and subject are equally matched, and both mature.&nbsp; In <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
there is a roundabout method, a painful poring subtlety and minuteness,
a marvellous combination of Sterne and Defoe, resulting in something
very little like any book written by either man: in &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain&rdquo; a straightforward, confident, unqualified revelation
that seems almost unconsidered.</p>
<h2><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>CHAPTER
VIII&mdash;CHILDHOOD</h2>
<p>And now for some raw bones of the life of a man who was born in 1803
and died in 1881, bones picked white and dry by the winds of thirty,
forty, fifty, and a hundred years.</p>
<p>Thomas Borrow, his father, an eighth and youngest son, was born in
1758 of a yeoman family long and still settled in Cornwall, near Liskeard.&nbsp;
He worked for some time on his brother&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; At nineteen
he joined the Militia and was apprenticed to a maltster, but, having
knocked his master down in a free fight at Menheniot Fair in 1783, disappeared
and enlisted as a private in the Coldstream Guards.&nbsp; He was then
a man of fresh complexion and light brown hair, just under five feet
eight inches in height.&nbsp; He was a sergeant when he was transferred
nine years later to the West Norfolk Regiment of Militia.&nbsp; In 1798
he was promoted to the office of adjutant with the rank of captain.&nbsp;
In 1793 he had married Ann Perfrement, a tenant farmer&rsquo;s daughter
from East Dereham, and probably of French Protestant descent, whom he
had first met when she was playing a minor part as an amateur at East
Dereham with a company from the Theatre Royal at Norwich.&nbsp; She
had, says Borrow, dark brilliant eyes, oval face, olive complexion,
and Grecian forehead.</p>
<p>The first child of this marriage, John Thomas, was born in 1800.&nbsp;
Borrow describes this elder brother as a beautiful child of &ldquo;rosy,
angelic face, blue eyes and light chestnut hair,&rdquo; yet of &ldquo;not
exactly an Anglo-Saxon countenance,&rdquo; having something of &ldquo;the
Celtic character, particularly in <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the
fire and vivacity which illumined it.&rdquo;&nbsp; John was his father&rsquo;s
favourite.&nbsp; He entered the army and became a lieutenant, but also,
and especially after the end of the war, a painter, studying under B.
R. Haydon and old Crome.&nbsp; He went out to Mexico in the service
of a mining company in 1826, and died there in 1834.</p>
<p>George Borrow was born in 1803 at another station of the regiment,
East Dereham.&nbsp; He calls himself a gloomy child, a &ldquo;lover
of nooks and retired corners . . . sitting for hours together with my
head on my breast . . . conscious of a peculiar heaviness within me,
and at times of a strange sensation of fear, which occasionally amounted
to horror, and for which I could assign no real cause whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A maidservant thought him a little wrong in the head, but a Jew pedlar
rebuked her for saying so, and said the child had &ldquo;all the look
of one of our people&rsquo;s children,&rdquo; and praised his bright
eyes.&nbsp; With the regiment he travelled along the Sussex and Kent
coast during the next four years.&nbsp; They were at Pett in 1806, and
there he tells us that he first handled a viper, fearless and unharmed.&nbsp;
In 1806 also they were at Hythe, where he saw the skulls of the Danes.&nbsp;
They were at Canterbury in 1807, and near there was the scene of his
eating the &ldquo;green, red, and purple&rdquo; berries from the hedge
and suffering convulsions.&nbsp; They were, says Dr. Knapp, from the
regimental records, never at Winchester, but at Winchelsea.&nbsp; In
1809 and 1810 they were back at Dereham, which was then the home of
Eleanor Fenn, his &ldquo;Lady Bountiful,&rdquo; widow of the editor
of the &ldquo;Paston Letters,&rdquo; Sir John Fenn.&nbsp; He had &ldquo;increased
rapidly in size and in strength,&rdquo; but not in mind, and could read
only imperfectly until &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; drew him out.&nbsp;
He went to church twice on Sundays, and never heard God&rsquo;s name
without a tremor, &ldquo;for I now knew that God was an awful and inscrutable
being, the maker of all things; that we <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>were
His children, and that we, by our sins, had justly offended Him; that
we were in very great peril from His anger, not so much in this life
as in another and far stranger state of being yet to come; that we had
a Saviour withal to whom it was necessary to look for help: upon this
point, however, I was yet very much in the dark, as, indeed, were most
of those with whom I was connected.&nbsp; The power and terrors of God
were uppermost in my thoughts; they fascinated though they astounded

<p>Later in 1810 he was at Norman Cross, in Huntingdonshire, and was
free to wander alone by Whittlesea Mere.&nbsp; There he met the old
viper-hunter and herbalist, into whose mouth he puts the tale of the
King of the Vipers.&nbsp; There he met the Gypsies.&nbsp; He answered
their threats with a viper that had lain hid in his breast; they called
him &ldquo;Sapengro, a chap who catches snakes and plays tricks with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sworn brother to Jasper, the son, who despised
him for being puny.</p>
<p>The Borrows were at Dereham again in 1811, and George went to school
&ldquo;for the acquisition of Latin,&rdquo; and learnt the whole of
Lilly&rsquo;s Grammar by heart.&nbsp; Other marches of the regiment
left him time to wonder at that &ldquo;stupendous erection, the aqueduct
at Stockport&rdquo;&mdash;to visit Durham and &ldquo;a capital old inn&rdquo;
there, where he had &ldquo;a capital dinner off roast Durham beef, and
a capital glass of ale, which I believe was the cause of my being ever
after fond of ale&rdquo;&mdash;so he told the Durham miner whom he met
on his way to the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge, in Cardiganshire&mdash;and to
attend school at Huddersfield in 1812 and at Edinburgh in 1813 and 1814.</p>
<p>He mentions the frequent fights at the High School and the pitched
battles between the Old and the New Town.&nbsp; Climbing the Castle
Rock was his favourite diversion, and on one &ldquo;horrible edge&rdquo;
he came upon David Haggart sitting and thinking of William Wallace:</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>&ldquo;And
why were ye thinking of him?&rdquo; Borrow says that he asked the lad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The English hanged him long since, as I have heard say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that I should wish
to be like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye mean,&rdquo; Borrow says that he said, &ldquo;that ye
would wish to be hanged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This youth was a drummer boy in Captain Borrow&rsquo;s regiment.&nbsp;
Borrow describes him upsetting the New Town champion in one of the bickers.&nbsp;
Seven years later he was condemned to death at Edinburgh, and to earn
a little money for his mother he dictated an account of his life to
the prison chaplain before he died.&nbsp; It was published in 1821 with
the title: &ldquo;The Life of David Haggart, alias John Wilson, alias
John Morison, alias Barney M&rsquo;Coul, alias John M&rsquo;Colgan,
alias David O&rsquo;Brien, alias the Switcher.&nbsp; Written by himself,
while under sentence of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is worth reading, notable
in itself and for its style.</p>
<p>He was a gamekeeper&rsquo;s son, and being a merry boy was liberally
tipped by sportsmen.&nbsp; Yet he ran away from home at the age of ten.&nbsp;
One of his first exploits was the stealing of a bantam cock.&nbsp; It
belonged to a woman at the back of the New Town of Edinburgh, says he,
and he took a great fancy to it, &ldquo;for it was a real beauty and
I offered to <i>buy</i>, but mistress would not <i>sell</i>, so I got
another cock, and set the two a fighting, and then off with my prize.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is like Mr. W. B. Yeats&rsquo; Paddy Cockfight in &ldquo;Where
there is nothing&rdquo;; he got a fighting cock from a man below Mullingar&mdash;&ldquo;The
first day I saw him I fastened my eyes on him, he preyed on my mind,
and next night if I didn&rsquo;t go back every foot of nine miles to
put him in my bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was twelve he got drunk at the
Leith races and enlisted in the Norfolk Militia, which had a recruiting
party for patriots at the races.&nbsp; &ldquo;I learned,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;to beat the drum very well in the course of three <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>months,
and afterwards made considerable progress in blowing the bugle-horn.&nbsp;
I liked the red coat and the soldiering well enough for a while, but
soon tired.&nbsp; We were too much confined, and there was too little
pay for me;&rdquo; and so he got his discharge.&nbsp; &ldquo;The restraining
influences of military discipline,&rdquo; says Dr. Knapp, &ldquo;gradually
wore away.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went back to school even, but in vain.&nbsp;
He was &ldquo;never happier in his life&rdquo; than when he &ldquo;fingered
all this money&rdquo;&mdash;&pound;200 acquired by theft.&nbsp; He worked
at his trade of thieving in many parts of Scotland and Ireland.&nbsp;
As early as 1818 he was sentenced to death, but escaped, and, being
recognised by a policeman, killed him and got clear away.&nbsp; He served
one or two sentences and escaped from another.&nbsp; He escaped a third
time, with a friend, after hitting the gaoler in such a manner that
he afterwards died.&nbsp; The friend was caught at once, but David ran
well&mdash;&ldquo;never did a fox double the hounds in better style&rdquo;&mdash;and
got away in woman&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp; As he was resting in a haystack
after his run of ten miles in an hour, he heard a woman ask &ldquo;if
that lad was taken that had broken out of Dumfries Gaol,&rdquo; and
the answer: &ldquo;No; but the gaoler died last night at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He got arrested in Ireland through sheer carelessness, was recognised
and taken in irons to Dumfries again&mdash;and so he died.</p>
<p>In 1814 and 1815 Borrow was for a time at the Grammar School at Norwich,
but sailed with the regiment &ldquo;in the autumn of the year 1815&rdquo;
for Ireland.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the eighth day of our voyage,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;we were in sight of Ireland.&nbsp; The weather was now
calm and serene, the sun shone brightly on the sea and on certain green
hills in the distance, on which I descried what at first sight I believed
to be two ladies gathering flowers, which, however, on our near approach,
proved to be two tall white towers, doubtless built for some purpose
or other, though I did not learn for what.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was at &ldquo;the
Protestant Academy&rdquo; at Clonmel, and <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>&ldquo;read
the Latin tongue and the Greek letters with a nice old clergyman.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From a schoolfellow he learnt something of the Irish tongue in exchange
for a pack of cards.</p>
<p>School, he says, had helped him to cast aside, in a great degree,
his unsocial habits and natural reserve, and when he moved to Templemore,
where there was no school, he roamed about the wild country, &ldquo;sometimes
entering the cabins of the peasantry with a &lsquo;God&rsquo;s blessing
upon you good people!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, as in Scotland, he seems
to have done as he liked.&nbsp; His father had other things to do than
look after the child whom he was later on to upbraid for growing up
in a displeasing way.&nbsp; Ireland made a strong impression upon the
boy, if we may judge from his writing about it when he looked back on
those days.&nbsp; He recalls, in &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; hearing the
glorious tune of &ldquo;Croppies lie Down&rdquo; in the barrack yard
at Clonmel.&nbsp; Again and again he recalls Murtagh, the wild Irish
boy who taught him Irish for a pack of cards.&nbsp; In Ireland he learnt
to be &ldquo;a frank rider&rdquo; without a saddle, and had awakened
in him his &ldquo;passion for the equine race&rdquo;: and here he had
his cob shoed by a &ldquo;fairy smith&rdquo; who first roused the animal
to a frenzy by uttering a strange word &ldquo;in a sharp pungent tone,&rdquo;
and then calmed it by another word &ldquo;in a voice singularly modified
but sweet and almost plaintive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above all there is a mystery
which might easily be called Celtic about his memories of Ireland, due
chiefly to something in his own blood, but also to the Irish atmosphere
which evoked that something in its perfection.</p>
<p>After less than a year in Ireland the regiment was back at Norwich,
and war being at an end, the men were mustered out in 1815.</p>

<h2><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>CHAPTER
IX&mdash;SCHOOLDAYS</h2>
<p>The Borrows now settled at Norwich in what was then King&rsquo;s
Court and is now Borrow&rsquo;s Court, off Willow Lane.&nbsp; George
Borrow, therefore, again attended the Grammar School of Norwich.&nbsp;
He could then, he says, read Greek.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s dissatisfaction
was apparently due to some instinctive antipathy for the child, who
had neither his hair nor his eyes, but was &ldquo;absolutely swarthy,
God forgive me!&nbsp; I had almost said like that of a Gypsy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As in Scotland and Ireland, so now at Norwich, Captain Borrow probably
let the boy do what he liked.&nbsp; As for Mrs. Borrow, perhaps she
favoured the boy, who took after her in eyes and complexion, if not
also in temperament.&nbsp; Her influence was of an unconscious kind,
strengthening her prenatal influence; unlike her husband, she had no
doubt that &ldquo;Providence&rdquo; would take care of the boy.&nbsp;
Borrow, at least, thought her like himself.&nbsp; In a suppressed portion
of the twentieth chapter of &ldquo;Lavengo&rdquo; he makes his parents
talk together in the garden, and the mother having a story to tell suggests
their going in because it is growing dark.&nbsp; The father says that
a tale of terror is the better for being told in the dark, and hopes
she is not afraid.&nbsp; The mother scoffs at the mention of fear, and
yet, she says, she feels a thrill as if something were casting a cold
shadow on her.&nbsp; She wonders if this feeling is like the indescribable
fear, &ldquo;which he calls the shadow,&rdquo; which sometimes attacks
her younger child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind the child or his shadow,&rdquo;
says the father, and bids her go on.&nbsp; And from what follows the
mother has evidently told the story before to her son.&nbsp; This <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>dialogue
may very well express the contrast between husband and wife and their
attitudes towards their younger son.&nbsp; Borrow very eloquently addresses
his father as &ldquo;a noble specimen of those strong single-minded
Englishmen, who, without making a parade either of religion or loyalty,
feared God and honoured their king, and were not particularly friendly
to the French,&rdquo; and as a pugilist who almost vanquished the famous
Ben Bryan; but he does not conceal the fact that he was &ldquo;so little
to thee that thou understoodst me not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Norwich Grammar School Borrow had as schoolfellows James Martineau
and James Brooke, afterwards Rajah of Sarawak.&nbsp; The headmaster
was one Edward Valpy, who thrashed Borrow, and there is nothing more
to be said.&nbsp; The boy was fond of study but not of school.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For want of something better to do,&rdquo; he taught himself
some French and Italian, but wished he had a master.&nbsp; A master
was found in a French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i>, the Rev. Thomas D&rsquo;Eterville,
who gave private lessons to Borrow, among others, in French, Italian
and Spanish.&nbsp; His other teachers were an old musket with which
he shot bullfinches, blackbirds and linnets, a fishing rod with which
he haunted the Yare, and the sporting gent, John Thurtell, who taught
him to box and accustomed him to pugilism.</p>
<p>Something is known of Thurtell apart from Borrow.&nbsp; He was the
son of a man who was afterwards Mayor of Norwich.&nbsp; He had been
a soldier and he was now in business.&nbsp; He arranged prize fights
and boxed himself.&nbsp; He afterwards murdered a man who had dishonestly
relieved him of &pound;400 at gambling, and he was executed for the
offence at Hertford in 1824.&nbsp; The trial was celebrated.&nbsp; It
was there that a &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; man was defined by a witness
as one who &ldquo;kept a gig.&rdquo;&nbsp; The trial was included in
the &ldquo;Celebrated Trials and Remarkable Cases of Criminal Jurisprudence&rdquo;
which Borrow compiled <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>in
1825; and Borrow may have written this description of the accused:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thurtell was dressed in a plum-coloured frock coat, with a
drab waistcoat and gilt buttons, and white corded breeches.&nbsp; His
neck had a black stock on, which fitted as usual stiffly up to the bottom
of the cheek and end of the chin, and which therefore pushed forward
the flesh on this part of the face so as to give an additionally sullen
weight to the countenance.&nbsp; The lower part of the face was unusually
large, muscular and heavy, and appeared to hang like a load to the head,
and to make it drop like the mastiff&rsquo;s jowl.&nbsp; The upper lip
was long and large, and the mouth had a severe and dogged appearance.&nbsp;
His nose was rather small for such a face, but it was not badly shaped;
his eyes, too, were small and buried deep under his protruding forehead,
so indeed as to defy detection of their colour.&nbsp; The forehead was
extremely strong, bony and knotted&mdash;and the eyebrows were forcibly
marked though irregular&mdash;that over the right eye being nearly straight
and that on the left turning up to a point so as to give a very painful
expression to the whole face.&nbsp; His hair was of a good lightish
brown, and not worn after any fashion.&nbsp; His frame was exceedingly
well knit and athletic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An eye witness reports that seven hours before his execution, Thurtell
said: &ldquo;It is perhaps wrong in my situation, but I own I should
like to read Pierce Egan&rsquo;s account of the great fight yesterday&rdquo;
(meaning that between Spring and Langan).&nbsp; He slept well through
his last night, and said: &ldquo;I have dreamt many odd things, but
I never dreamt anything about <i>this business</i> since I have been
in Hertford.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pierce Egan described the trial and execution,
and how Thurtell bowed in a friendly and dignified manner to someone&mdash;&ldquo;we
believe, Mr. Pierce Egan&rdquo;&mdash;in the crowd about the gallows.&nbsp;
Pierce Egan did not mention the sound of his cracking neck, but Borrow
is reported to have said <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>it
was a shame to hang such a man as Thurtell: &ldquo;Why, when his neck
broke it went off like a pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thurtell is the second of Borrow&rsquo;s friends who preceded him
in fame.</p>
<p>During his school days under Valpy, Borrow met his sworn brother
again&mdash;the Gypsy Petulengro.&nbsp; He places this meeting at the
Tombland Fair at Norwich, and Dr. Knapp fixes it, precisely, on March
19, 1818.&nbsp; According to Borrow&rsquo;s account, which is the only
one, he was shadowed and then greeted by Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; They
went together to the Gypsy encampment on Household Heath, and they were
together there often again, in spite of the hostility of one Gypsy,
Mrs. Herne, to Borrow.&nbsp; He says that he went with them to fairs
and markets and learnt their language in spite of Mrs. Herne, so that
they called him Lav-engro, or Word Master.&nbsp; The mighty Tawno Chikno
also called him Cooro-mengro, because of his mastery with the fist.&nbsp;
He was then sixteen.&nbsp; He is said to have stained his face to darken
it further, and to have been asked by Valpy: &ldquo;Is that jaundice
or only dirt, Borrow?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>CHAPTER
X&mdash;LEAVING SCHOOL</h2>
<p>With so much liberty Borrow desired more.&nbsp; He played truant
and, as we have seen, was thrashed for it.&nbsp; He was soon to leave
school for good, though there is nothing to prove that he left on account
of this escapade, or that the thrashing produced the &ldquo;symptoms
of a rapid decline,&rdquo; with a failure of strength and appetite,
which he speaks of in the eighteenth chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
after the Gypsies had gone away.&nbsp; He was almost given over by the
physicians, he tells us, but cured by an &ldquo;ancient female, a kind
of doctress,&rdquo; with a decoction of &ldquo;a bitter root which grows
on commons and desolate places.&rdquo;&nbsp; An attack of &ldquo;the
dark feeling of mysterious dread&rdquo; came with convalescence.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;never during any portion of my life did time flow on more
speedily,&rdquo; he says, than during the next two or three years.&nbsp;
After some hesitation between Church and Law, he was articled in 1819
to Messrs. Simpson and Rackham, solicitors, of Tuck&rsquo;s Court, St.
Giles&rsquo;, Norwich, and he lived with Simpson in the Upper Close.&nbsp;
As a friend said, the law was an excellent profession for those who
never intend to follow it.&nbsp; As Borrow himself said, &ldquo;I have
ever loved to be as explicit as possible; on which account, perhaps,
I never attained to any proficiency in the law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
sat faithfully at his desk and learned a good deal of Welsh, Danish,
Hebrew, Arabic, Gaelic, and Armenian, making translations from these
languages in prose and verse.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; he recalls
translating Danish poems &ldquo;over the desk of his ancient master,
the gentleman solicitor of East Anglia,&rdquo; and learning Welsh by
reading <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>a
Welsh &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; side by side with the original, and
by having lessons on Sunday afternoons at his father&rsquo;s house from
a groom named Lloyd.</p>
<p>His chief master was William Taylor, the &ldquo;Anglo-Germanist&rdquo;
of &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taylor was born in 1765.&nbsp; He studied
in Germany as a youth and returned to England with a great enthusiasm
for German literature.&nbsp; He translated Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iphigenia&rdquo;
(1793), Lessing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nathan&rdquo; (1791), Wieland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dialogues of the Gods,&rdquo; etc. (1795); he published &ldquo;Tales
of Yore,&rdquo; translated from several languages, and a &ldquo;Letter
concerning the two first chapters of Luke,&rdquo; in 1810, &ldquo;English
Synonyms discriminated&rdquo; in 1813, and an &ldquo;Historical Survey
of German Poetry,&rdquo; interspersed with various translations, in
1823-30.&nbsp; He was bred among Unitarians, read Hume, Voltaire and
Rousseau, disliked the Church, and welcomed the French Revolution, though
he was no friend to &ldquo;the cause of national ambition and aggrandisement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He belonged to a Revolution Society at Norwich, and in 1790 wrote from
Paris calling the National Assembly &ldquo;that well-head of philosophical
legislation, whose pure streams are now overflowing the fairest country
upon earth and will soon be sluiced off into the other realms of Europe,
fertilising all with the living energy of its waters.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1791 he and his father withdrew their capital from manufacture and William
Taylor devoted himself to literature.&nbsp; Hazlitt speaks of the &ldquo;style
of philosophical criticism which has been the boast of the &lsquo;Edinburgh
Review,&rsquo;&rdquo; as first introduced into the &ldquo;Monthly Review&rdquo;
by Taylor in 1796.&nbsp; Scott said that Taylor&rsquo;s translation
of Burger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lenore&rdquo; made him a poet.&nbsp; Sir James
Mackintosh learned the Taylorian language for the sake of the man&rsquo;s
&ldquo;vigour and originality&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;As the Hebrew is studied
for one book, so is the Taylorian by me for one author.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>I
will give a few hints at the nature of his speculation.&nbsp; In one
of his letters he speaks of stumbling on &ldquo;the new hypothesis that
the Nebuchadnezzar of Scripture is the Cyrus of Greek History,&rdquo;
and second, that &ldquo;David, the Jew, a favourite of this prince,
wrote all those oracles scattered in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel relative
to his enterprises, for the particularisation of which they afford ample
materials.&rdquo;&nbsp; Writing of his analysis, in the &ldquo;Critical
Review,&rdquo; of Paulus&rsquo; Commentary on the New Testament, he
blames the editor for a suppression&mdash;&ldquo;an attempt to prove,
from the first and second chapter of Luke, that Zacharias, who wrote
these chapters, meant to hold himself out as the father of Jesus Christ
as well as of John the Baptist.&nbsp; The Jewish idea of being conceived
of the Holy Ghost did not exclude the idea of human parentage.&nbsp;
The rabbinical commentator on Genesis explains this.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was called &ldquo;Godless Billy Taylor,&rdquo; but says he: &ldquo;When
I publish my other pamphlet in proof of the great truth that Jesus Christ
wrote the &lsquo;Wisdom&rsquo; and translated the &lsquo;Ecclesiasticus&rsquo;
from the Hebrew of his grandfather Hillel, you will be convinced (that
I am convinced) that I and I alone am a precise and classical Christian;
the only man alive who thinks concerning the person and doctrines of
Christ what he himself thought and taught.&rdquo;&nbsp; His &ldquo;Letter
concerning the two first chapters of Luke&rdquo; has the further title,
&ldquo;Who was the father of Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; He calls &ldquo;not
absolutely indefensible&rdquo; the opinion of the anonymous German author
of the &ldquo;Natural History of Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; that Joseph
of Arimath&aelig;a was the father of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He mentions
that &ldquo;a more recent anonymous theorist, with greater plausibility,
imagines that the acolytes employed in the Temple of Jerusalem were
called by the names of angels, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, accordingly
as they were stationed behind, beside, or before, the mercy-seat; and
that the Gabriel of the Temple found means to <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>impose
on the innocence of the virgin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;is in many ways compatible with Mary&rsquo;s having faithfully
given the testimony put together by Luke.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gives at great
length the arguments in favour of Zacharias as the father, and tells
Josephus&rsquo; story of Mundus and Paulina. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68">{68}</a></p>
<p>Norwich was then &ldquo;a little Academe among provincial cities,&rdquo;
as Mr. Seccombe calls it; he continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the high lights of the illuminated capital of East Anglia
were the Cromes, the Opies, John Sell Cotman, Elizabeth Fry, Dr. William
Enfield (of Speaker fame), and Dr. Rigby, the father of Lady Eastlake;
but pre-eminent above all reigned the twin cliques of Taylors and Martineaus,
who amalgamated at impressive intervals for purposes of mutual elevation
and refinement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The salon of Susannah Taylor, the mother of Sarah Austin,
the wife of John Taylor, hymn writer and deacon of the seminal chapel,
the once noted Octagon, in Norwich, included in its zenith Sir James
Mackintosh, Mrs. Barbauld, Crabb Robinson, the solemn Dr. John Alderson,
Amelia Opie, Henry Reeve of Edinburgh fame, Basil Montagu, the Sewards,
the Quaker Gurneys of Earlham, and Dr. Frank Sayers, whom the German
critics compared to Gray, who had handled the Norse mythology in poetry,
to which Borrow was introduced by Sayer&rsquo;s private biographer,
the eminent and aforesaid William Taylor&rdquo; [no relation of <i>the</i>
&ldquo;Taylors of Norwich&rdquo;] &ldquo;whose &lsquo;Jail-delivery
of German Studies&rsquo; the jealous Thomas Carlyle stigmatized in 1830
as the work of a natural-born English Philistine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of <i>the</i> Taylors and the Martineaus,
says William Taylor&rsquo;s biographer, Robberds: &ldquo;The love of
society almost necessarily produces the habit of indulging in the pleasures
of the table; and, though he cannot be charged with having carried this
to an <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>immoderate
excess, still the daily repetition of it had taxed too much the powers
of nature and exhausted them before the usual period.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taylor
died in 1836 and was remembered best for his drinking and for his bloated
appearance.&nbsp; Harriet Martineau wrote of him in her autobiography:</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Taylor was managed by a regular process, first of
feeding, then of wine-bibbing, and immediately after of poking to make
him talk: and then came his sayings, devoured by the gentlemen and making
ladies and children aghast;&mdash;defences of suicide, avowals that
snuff alone had rescued him from it: information given as certain that
&lsquo;God Save the King&rsquo; was sung by Jeremiah in the Temple of
Solomon,&mdash;that Christ was watched on the day of His supposed ascension,
and observed to hide Himself till dark, and then to make His way down
the other side of the mountain; and other such plagiarisms from the
German Rationalists.&nbsp; When William Taylor began with &lsquo;I firmly
believe,&rsquo; we knew that something particularly incredible was coming.
. . . His virtues as a son were before our eyes when we witnessed his
endurance of his father&rsquo;s brutality of temper and manners, and
his watchfulness in ministering to the old man&rsquo;s comfort in his
infirmities.&nbsp; When we saw, on a Sunday morning, William Taylor
guiding his blind mother to chapel, and getting her there with her shoes
as clean as if she had crossed no gutters in those flint-paved streets,
we could forgive anything that had shocked or disgusted us at the dinner
table.&nbsp; But matters grew worse in his old age, when his habits
of intemperance kept him out of the sight of the ladies, and he got
round him a set of ignorant and conceited young men, who thought they
could set the world right by their destructive tendencies.&nbsp; One
of his chief favourites was George Borrow. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of &ldquo;the harum-scarum young men&rdquo; taken up by <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Taylor
and introduced &ldquo;into the best society the place afforded,&rdquo;
writes Harriet Martineau, was Polidori.</p>
<p>Borrow was introduced to Taylor in 1820 by &ldquo;Mousha,&rdquo;
the Jew who taught him Hebrew.&nbsp; Taylor &ldquo;took a great interest&rdquo;
in him and taught him German.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I tell Borrow <i>once</i>,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;he ever remembers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1821 Taylor wrote
to Southey, who was an early friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Norwich young man is construing with me Schiller&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Wilhelm Tell,&rsquo; with the view of translating it for the
Press.&nbsp; His name is George Henry Borrow, and he has learnt German
with extraordinary rapidity; indeed he has the gift of tongues, and,
though not yet eighteen, understands twelve languages&mdash;English,
Welsh, Erse, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, Danish, French, Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese; he would like to get into the Office for Foreign
Affairs, but does not know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was at that time a &ldquo;reserved and solitary&rdquo; youth,
tall, spare, dark complexioned and usually dressed in black, who used
to be seen hanging about the Close and talking through the railings
of his garden to some of the Grammar School boys.&nbsp; He was a noticeable
youth, and he told his father that a lady had painted him and compared
his face to that of Alfieri&rsquo;s Saul.</p>
<p class="picture">

</a></p>
<p>Borrow pleased neither his master nor his father by his knowledge
of languages, though it was largely acquired in the lawyer&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The lad is too independent by half,&rdquo; Borrow makes his father
say, after painting a filial portrait of the old man, &ldquo;with locks
of silver gray which set off so nobly his fine bold but benevolent face,
his faithful consort at his side, and his trusty dog at his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nor did the youth please himself.&nbsp; He was languid again, tired
even of the Welsh poet, Ab Gwilym.&nbsp; He was anxious about his father,
who was low spirited over his elder son&rsquo;s absence in London as
a painter, and over his younger son&rsquo;s misconduct and the &ldquo;strange
notions and doctrines&rdquo;&mdash;especially <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the
doctrine that everyone has a right to dispose as he thinks best of that
which is his own, even of his life&mdash;which he had imbibed from Taylor.&nbsp;
Taylor was &ldquo;fond of getting hold of young men and, according to
orthodox accounts, doing them a deal of harm.&rdquo; <a name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a">{71a}</a>&nbsp;
His views, says Dr. Knapp, sank deep &ldquo;into the organism of his
pupil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;would only be eradicated, if at all, through
much suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Knapp thought that the execution of
Thurtell ought to have produced a &ldquo;favourable change in his mode
of thinking&rdquo;&mdash;as if prize fighting and murder were not far
more common among Christians than atheists.&nbsp; But if Borrow had
never met Taylor he would have met someone else, atheist or religious
enthusiast, who would have lured him from the straight, smooth, flowery
path of orthodoxy; otherwise he might have been a clergyman or he might
have been Dr. Knapp, but he would not have been George Borrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would that I had
never been born!&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; And it was an open
air ranter, not a clergyman or unobtrusive godly man, that made him
exclaim: &ldquo;Would that my life had been like his&mdash;even like
that man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Gypsy reminded him of &ldquo;the
wind on the heath&rdquo; and the boxing gloves.</p>
<p>When his father asked Borrow what he proposed to do, <a name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b">{71b}</a>
seeing that he was likely to do nothing at law, he had nothing to suggest.&nbsp;
Southey apparently could not help him to the Foreign Office.&nbsp; The
only opening that can have seemed possible to him was literature.&nbsp;
He might, for example, produce a volume of translations like the &ldquo;Specimen
of Russian Poets&rdquo; (1820) of John Bowring, whom he met at Taylor&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Bowring, a man of twenty-nine in 1821, was the head of a commercial
firm and afterwards a friend of Borrow and the author of many translations
from <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Russian,
Dutch, Spanish, Polish, Servian, Hungarian and Bohemian song.&nbsp;
He was, as the &ldquo;Old Radical&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
Borrow&rsquo;s victim in his lifetime, and after his death the victim
of Dr. Knapp as the supposed false friend of his hero.&nbsp; The mud
thrown at him had long since dried, and has now been brushed off in
a satisfactory manner by Mr. R. A. J. Walling. <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72">{72}</a></p>

XI&mdash;LITERATURE AND LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>When Borrow was in his nineteenth year&mdash;according to Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s
estimate&mdash;he told his father what he had done: &ldquo;I have learned
Welsh, and have translated the songs of Ab Gwilym, some ten thousand
lines, into English rhyme.&nbsp; I have also learnt Danish, and have
rendered the old book of Ballads into English metre.&nbsp; I have learned
many other tongues, and have acquired some knowledge even of Hebrew
and Arabic.&rdquo;&nbsp; He read and conversed with William Taylor;
he read alone in the Guildhall of Norwich, where the Corporation Library
offered him the books from which he gained &ldquo;his knowledge of Anglo-Saxon
and early English, Welsh or British, Northern or Scandinavian learning&rdquo;&mdash;so
writes Dr. Knapp, who has seen the &ldquo;neat young pencilled notes&rdquo;
of Borrow in Edmund Lhuyd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Danica Literatura Antiquissima&rsquo; of Olaus Wormius,
etc.&nbsp; He tells us himself that he passed entire nights in reading
an old Danish book, till he was almost blind.</p>
<p>In 1823 Borrow began to publish his translations.&nbsp; Taylor introduced
him to Thomas Campbell, then editor of the &ldquo;New Monthly,&rdquo;
and to Sir Richard Phillips, editor and proprietor of the &ldquo;Monthly
Magazine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both editors printed Borrow&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Phillips was particularly flattering: he used Borrow&rsquo;s
article on &ldquo;Danish Poetry and Ballad Writing&rdquo; and about
six hundred lines of translation from German, Danish, Swedish and Dutch
poetry in the first year of the connection, usually with the signature,
&ldquo;George Olaus <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I will quote only one specimen, his version of Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Erl
King&rdquo; (&ldquo;Monthly Magazine,&rdquo; December, 1823):</p>
<blockquote><p>Who is it that gallops so late on the wild!<br />
O it is the father that carries his child!<br />
He presses him close in his circling arm,<br />
To save him from cold, and to shield him from harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear baby, what makes ye your countenance hide?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Spur, father, your courser and rowel his side;<br />
The Erl-King is chasing us over the heath;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Peace, baby, thou seest a vapoury wreath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear boy, come with me, and I&rsquo;ll join in your sport,<br />
And show ye the place where the fairies resort;<br />
My mother, who dwells in the cool pleasant mine<br />
Shall clothe thee in garments so fair and so fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, my father, in mercy attend,<br />
And hear what is said by the whispering fiend.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Be quiet, be quiet, my dearly-loved child;<br />
&rsquo;Tis naught but the wind as it stirs in the wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear baby, if thou wilt but venture with me,<br />
My daughter shall dandle thy form on her knee;<br />
My daughter, who dwells where the moon-shadows play,<br />
Shall lull ye to sleep with the song of the fay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, my father, and seest thou not<br />
His sorceress daughter in yonder dark spot?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I see something truly, thou dear little fool,&mdash;<br />
I see the great alders that hang by the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet baby, I doat on that beautiful form,<br />
And thou shalt ride with me the wings of the storm.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O father, my father, he grapples me now,<br />
And already has done me a mischief, I vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father was terrified, onward he press&rsquo;d,<br />
And closer he cradled the child to his breast,<br />
And reach&rsquo;d the far cottage, and, wild with alarm,<br />
He found that the baby hung dead on his arm!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only criticism that need be passed on this is that any man of
some intelligence and patience can hope to do as well: he seldom wrote
any verse that was either much better or much worse.&nbsp; At the same
time it must not be <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>forgotten
that the success of the translation is no measure of the impression
made on the young Borrow by the legend.</p>
<p>His translations from Ab Gwilym are not interesting either to lovers
of that poet or to lovers of Borrow: some are preserved in a sort of
life in death in the pages of &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the German he had also translated F. M. Von Klinger&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faustus: his life, death and descent into hell.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<a name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a">{75a}</a>&nbsp; The
preface announces that &ldquo;although scenes of vice and crime are
here exhibited, it is merely in the hope that they may serve as beacons,
to guide the ignorant and unwary from the shoals on which they might
otherwise be wrecked.&rdquo;&nbsp; He insisted, furthermore, that the
book contained &ldquo;the highly useful advice,&rdquo; that everyone
should bear their lot in patience and not seek &ldquo;at the expense
of his repose to penetrate into those secrets which the spirit of man,
while dressed in the garb of mortality cannot and must not unveil. .
. . To the mind of man all is dark; he is an enigma to himself; let
him live, therefore, in the hope of once seeing clearly; and happy indeed
is he who in that manner passeth his days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Danish of Johannes Evald, he translated &ldquo;The Death
of Balder,&rdquo; a play, into blank verse with consistently feminine
endings, as in this speech of Thor to Balder: <a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b">{75b}</a></p>
<blockquote><p>How long dost think, degenerate son of Odin,<br />
Unmanly pining for a foolish maiden,<br />
And all the weary train of love-sick follies,<br />
Will move a bosom that is steel&rsquo;d by virtue?<br />
Thou dotest!&nbsp; Dote and weep, in tears swim ever;<br />
But by thy father&rsquo;s arm, by Odin&rsquo;s honour,<br />
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Haste,
hide thy tears and thee in shades of alder!<br />
Haste to the still, the peace-accustom&rsquo;d valley,<br />
Where lazy herdsmen dance amid the clover.<br />
There wet each leaf which soft the west wind kisses,<br />
Each plant which breathes around voluptuous odours,<br />
With tears!&nbsp; There sigh and moan, and the tired peasant<br />
Shall hear thee, and, behind his ploughshare resting,<br />
Shall wonder at thy grief, and pity Balder!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lyrics interspersed.&nbsp; The following is sung by three
Valkyries marching round the cauldron before Rota dips the fatal spear
that she is to present to Hother:</p>
<blockquote><p>In juice of rue<br />
And trefoil too;<br />
In marrow of bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blood of Trold,<br />
Be cool&rsquo;d the spear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Threetimes cool&rsquo;d,<br />
When hot from blazes<br />
Which Nastroud raises<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Valhall&rsquo;s May.</p>
<p>1st Valk.&nbsp; Whom it woundeth,<br />
It shall slay.</p>
<p>2nd Whom it woundeth,<br />
It shall slay.</p>
<p>3rd Whom it woundeth,<br />
It shall slay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1826 he was to publish &ldquo;Romantic Ballads,&rdquo; translated
from the Gaelic, Danish, Norse, Swedish, and German, with eight original
pieces.&nbsp; He &ldquo;hoped shortly&rdquo; to publish a complete translation
of the &ldquo;Kj&aelig;mpe Viser&rdquo; and of Gaelic songs, made by
him &ldquo;some years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few of these are valuable or
interesting, but I must quote &ldquo;Svend Vonved&rdquo; because Borrow
himself so often refers to it.&nbsp; The legend haunted him of &ldquo;that
strange melancholy Swayne Vonved, who roams about the world propounding
people riddles; slaying those who cannot answer, and rewarding those
who <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>can
with golden bracelets.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was walking alone in wild
weather in Cornwall he roared it aloud:</p>
<blockquote><p>Svend Vonved sits in his lonely bower;<br />
He strikes his harp with a hand of power;<br />
His harp returned a responsive din;<br />
Then came his mother hurrying in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.</p>
<p>In came his mother Adeline,<br />
And who was she, but a queen so fine:<br />
&ldquo;Now hark, Svend Vonved! out must thou ride<br />
And wage stout battle with knights of pride.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avenge thy father&rsquo;s untimely end;<br />
To me, or another, thy gold harp lend;<br />
This moment boune thee, and straight begone!<br />
I rede thee, do it, my own dear son.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.</p>
<p>Svend Vonved binds his sword to his side;<br />
He fain will battle with knights of pride.<br />
&ldquo;When may I look for thee once more here?<br />
When roast the heifer and spice the beer?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When stones shall take, of themselves, a flight<br />
And ravens&rsquo; feathers are waxen white,<br />
Then may&rsquo;st thou expect Svend Vonved home:<br />
In all my days, I will never come.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look out, look out, Svend Vonved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we did not know that Borrow used these verses as a kind of incantation
we should be sorry to have read them.&nbsp; But one of the original
pieces in this book is as good in itself as it is interesting.&nbsp;
I mean &ldquo;Lines to Six-foot-three&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lad, who twenty tongues can talk,<br />
And sixty miles a day can walk;<br />
Drink at a draught a pint of rum,<br />
And then be neither sick nor dumb;<br />
Can tune a song, and make a verse,<br />
And deeds of northern kings rehearse;<br />
Who never will forsake his friend,<br />
While he his bony fist can bend;<br />
And, though averse to brawl and strife,<br />
Will fight a Dutchman with a knife.<br />
O that is just the lad for me,<br />
And such is honest six-foot three.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>A
braver being ne&rsquo;er had birth<br />
Since God first kneaded man from earth;<br />
O, I have come to know him well,<br />
As Ferroe&rsquo;s blacken&rsquo;d rocks can tell.<br />
Who was it did, at Suder&ouml;e,<br />
The deed no other dared to do?<br />
Who was it, when the Boff had burst,<br />
And whelm&rsquo;d me in its womb accurst,<br />
Who was it dashed amid the wave,<br />
With frantic zeal, my life to save?<br />
Who was it flung the rope to me?<br />
O, who, but honest six-foot three!</p>
<p>Who was it taught my willing tongue,<br />
The songs that Braga fram&rsquo;d and sung?<br />
Who was it op&rsquo;d to me the store<br />
Of dark unearthly Runic lore,<br />
And taught me to beguile my time<br />
With Denmark&rsquo;s aged and witching rhyme;<br />
To rest in thought in Elvir shades,<br />
And hear the song of fairy maids;<br />
Or climb the top of Dovrefeld,<br />
Where magic knights their muster held!<br />
Who was it did all this for me?<br />
O, who, but honest six-foot three!</p>
<p>Wherever fate shall bid me roam,<br />
Far, far from social joy and home;<br />
&rsquo;Mid burning Afric&rsquo;s desert sands;<br />
Or wild Kamschatka&rsquo;s frozen lands;<br />
Bit by the poison-loaded breeze<br />
Or blasts which clog with ice the seas;<br />
In lowly cot or lordly hall,<br />
In beggar&rsquo;s rags or robes of pall,<br />
&rsquo;Mong robber-bands or honest men,<br />
In crowded town or forest den,<br />
I never will unmindful be<br />
Of what I owe to six-foot three.</p>
<p>That form which moves with giant grace&mdash;<br />
That wild, tho&rsquo; not unhandsome face;<br />
That voice which sometimes in its tone<br />
Is softer than the wood-dove&rsquo;s moan,<br />
At others, louder than the storm<br />
Which beats the side of old Cairn Gorm;<br />
That hand, as white as falling snow,<br />
Which yet can fell the stoutest foe;<br />
And, last of all, that noble heart,<br />
Which ne&rsquo;er from honour&rsquo;s path would start,<br />
Shall never be forgot by me&mdash;<br />
So farewell, honest six-foot three.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>This
is already pure Borrow, with a vigour excusing if not quite transmuting
its rant.&nbsp; He creates a sort of hero in his own image, and it should
be read as an introduction and invocation to &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is one of the few contemporary
records of Borrow at about the age when he wrote &ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo;
made horse-shoes and fought the Blazing Tinman.&nbsp; So far as I know,
it was more than ten years before he wrote anything so good again, and
he never wrote anything better in verse, unless it is the song of the
&ldquo;genuine old English gentleman,&rdquo; in the twenty-fourth chapter
of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give me the haunch of a buck to eat, and to drink
Madeira old,<br />
And a gentle wife to rest with, and in my arms to fold,<br />
An Arabic book to study, a Norfolk cob to ride,<br />
And a house to live in shaded with trees, and near to a river side;<br />
With such good things around me, and blessed with good health withal,<br />
Though I should live for a hundred years, for death I would not call.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only other verse of his which can be remembered for any good
reason is this song from the Romany, included among the translations
from thirty languages and dialects which he published, in 1835, with
the title of &ldquo;Targum,&rdquo; and the appropriate motto: &ldquo;The
raven has ascended to the nest of the nightingale.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Gypsy verses are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The strength of the ox,<br />
The wit of the fox,<br />
And the leveret&rsquo;s speed,&mdash;<br />
Full oft to oppose<br />
To their numerous foes,<br />
The Rommany need.</p>
<p>Our horses they take,<br />
Our waggons they break,<br />
And ourselves they seize,<br />
In their prisons to coop,<br />
Where we pine and droop,<br />
For want of breeze.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>When
the dead swallow<br />
The fly shall follow<br />
O&rsquo;er Burra-panee,<br />
Then we will forget<br />
The wrongs we have met<br />
And forgiving be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will not be necessary to say anything more about Borrow&rsquo;s
verses.&nbsp; Poetry for him was above all declamatory sentiment or
wild narrative, and so he never wrote, and perhaps never cared much
for poetry, except ballads and his contemporary Byron.&nbsp; He desired,
as he said in the note to &ldquo;Romantic Ballads,&rdquo; not the merely
harmonious but the grand, and he condemned the modern muse for &ldquo;the
violent desire to be smooth and tuneful, forgetting that smoothness
and tunefulness are nearly synonymous with tameness and unmeaningness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He once said of Keats: &ldquo;They are attempting to resuscitate him,
I believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He regarded Wordsworth as a soporific merely.</p>
<h2><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>CHAPTER
XII&mdash;LONDON</h2>
<p>Early in 1824, and just before George Borrow&rsquo;s articles with
the solicitors expired, Captain Borrow died.&nbsp; He left all that
he had to his widow, with something for the maintenance and education
of the younger son during his minority.&nbsp; Borrow had already planned
to go to London, to write, to abuse religion and to get himself prosecuted.&nbsp;
A month later, the day after the expiration of his articles, before
he had quite reached his majority, he went up to London.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;cast upon the world&rdquo; in no very hopeful condition.&nbsp;
He had lately been laid up again&mdash;was it by the &ldquo;fear&rdquo;
or something else?&mdash;by a complaint which destroyed his strength,
impaired his understanding and threatened his life, as he wrote to a
friend: he was taking mercury for a cure.&nbsp; But he had his translations
from Ab Gwilym and his romantic ballads, and he believed in them.&nbsp;
He took them to Sir Richard Phillips, who did not believe in them, and
had moreover given up publishing.&nbsp; According to his own account,
which is very well known (Lavengro, chapter XXX.), Sir Richard suggested
that he should write something in the style of the &ldquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter&rdquo; instead.</p>
<p>Men of this generation, fortunate at least in this ignorance, probably
think of the &ldquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; as a fictitious
title, like the &ldquo;Oxford Review&rdquo; (which stood for &ldquo;The
Universal Review&rdquo;) and the &ldquo;Newgate Lives&rdquo; (which
should have been &ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo; etc.).&nbsp; But such
a book really was published in 1811.&nbsp; It was an &ldquo;authentic
narrative&rdquo; by a clergyman of the Church of <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>England
named Legh Richmond, who thought it &ldquo;delightful to trace and discover
the operations of Divine love among the poorer classes of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The book was about the conversion and holy life and early death of a
pale, delicate, consumptive dairyman&rsquo;s daughter in the Isle of
Wight.&nbsp; It became famous, was translated into many languages, and
was reprinted by some misguided or malevolent man not long ago.&nbsp;
I will give a specimen of the book which the writer of &ldquo;Six-foot-three&rdquo;
was asked to imitate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travellers, as they pass through the country, usually stop
to inquire whose are the splendid mansions which they discover among
the woods and plains around them.&nbsp; The families, titles, fortune,
or character of the respective owners, engage much attention. . . .
In the meantime, the lowly cottage of the poor husbandman is passed
by as scarcely deserving of notice.&nbsp; Yet, perchance, such a cottage
may often contain a treasure of infinitely more value than the sumptuous
palace of the rich man; even &ldquo;the pearl of great price.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If this be set in the heart of the poor cottager, it proves a jewel
of unspeakable value, and will shine among the brightest ornaments of
the Redeemer&rsquo;s crown, in that day when he maketh up his &ldquo;jewels.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence, the Christian traveller, while he bestows, in common
with others, his due share of applause on the decorations of the rich,
and is not insensible to the beauties and magnificence which are the
lawfully allowed appendages of rank and fortune, cannot overlook the
humbler dwelling of the poor.&nbsp; And if he should find that true
piety and grace beneath the thatched roof, which he has in vain looked
for amidst the worldly grandeur of the rich, he remembers the word of
God. . . . He sees, with admiration, that &lsquo;the high and lofty
One, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, who dwelleth in the
high and holy place, dwelleth with <i>him also</i> that is of a contrite
and <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>humble
spirit,&rsquo; Isaiah lvii., 15; and although heaven is his throne,
and the earth his footstool, yet when a home is to be built, and a place
of rest to be sought for himself, he says, &lsquo;To this man will I
look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth
at my word,&rsquo; Isaiah lxvi., 1, 2.&nbsp; When a home is thus tenanted,
faith beholds this inscription written on the walls, <i>The Lord lives
here</i>.&nbsp; Faith, therefore, cannot pass it by unnoticed, but loves
to lift up the latch of the door, and sit down, and converse with the
poor, though perhaps despised, inhabitant.&nbsp; Many a sweet interview
does faith obtain when she thus takes her walks abroad.&nbsp; Many such
a sweet interview have I myself enjoyed beneath the roof where dwelt
the Dairyman and his little family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon perceived that his daughter&rsquo;s health was rapidly
on the decline.&nbsp; The pale, wasting consumption, which is the Lord&rsquo;s
instrument for removing so many thousands every year from the land of
the living, made hasty strides on her constitution.&nbsp; The hollow
eye, the distressing cough, and the often too flattering red on the
cheek, foretold the approach of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often thought what a field for usefulness and affectionate
attention, on the part of ministers and Christian friends, is opened
by the frequent attacks and lingering progress of <i>consumptive</i>
illness.&nbsp; How many such precious opportunities are daily lost,
where Providence seems in so marked a way to afford time and space for
serious and Godly instruction!&nbsp; Of how many may it be said: &lsquo;The
way of peace have they not known&rsquo;; for not one friend ever came
nigh to warn them to &lsquo;flee from the wrath to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter was happily made acquainted
with the things which belonged to her everlasting peace before the present
disease had taken root in her constitution.&nbsp; In my visits to her
I might be said rather <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>to
receive information than to impart it.&nbsp; Her mind was abundantly
stored with Divine truths, and her conversations truly edifying.&nbsp;
The recollection of it still produces a thankful sensation in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Borrow had bought a copy of this book he was willing
to do what was asked, and to attempt also to translate into German Phillips&rsquo;
&ldquo;Proximate Causes of the Material Phenomena of the Universe,&rdquo;
or what the translator called &ldquo;his tale of an apple and a pear.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Phillips changed his mind about the &ldquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;
and commissioned a compilation of &ldquo;Newgate Lives and Trials&rdquo;
instead.&nbsp; Borrow failed with the translation of the &ldquo;Proximate
Causes&rdquo; but liked very well the compiling of the &ldquo;Celebrated
Trials&rdquo;&mdash;of Joan of Arc, Cagliostro, Mary Queen of Scots,
Raleigh, the Gunpowder Plotters, Queen Caroline, Thurtell, the Cato
Street Conspirators, and many more&mdash;in six volumes.&nbsp; He also
wrote reviews for Phillips&rsquo; Magazine, and contributed more translations
of poetry and many scraps of &ldquo;Danish Traditions and Superstitions,&rdquo;
like the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At East Hessing, in the district of Calling, there was once
a rural wedding; and when the morning was near at hand, the guests rushed
out of the house with much noise and tumult.&nbsp; When they were putting
their horses to the carts, in order to leave the place, each of them
boasted and bragged of his bridal present.&nbsp; But when the uproar
was at the highest, and they were all speaking together, a maiden dressed
in green, and with a bulrush plaited over her head, came from a neighbouring
morass, and going up to the fellow who was noisiest and bragged most
of his bridal gift, she said, &lsquo;What will you give to Lady B&oelig;?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The boor, who was half intoxicated from the brandy and ale he had swallowed,
seized a whip, and answered, &lsquo;Three strokes of my waggon-whip.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But at the same moment he fell a corpse to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>If
translation like this is journeyman&rsquo;s work for the journeyman,
for Borrow it was of great value because it familiarised him with the
marvellous and the supernatural and so helped him towards the expression
of his own material and spiritual adventures.&nbsp; The wild and often
other-worldly air of much of his work is doubtless due to his wild and
other-worldly mind, but owes a considerable if uncertain debt to his
reading of ballads and legends, which give a little to the substance
of his work and far more to the tone of it.&nbsp; Among other things
translated at this time he mentions the &ldquo;Saga of Burnt Njal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not happy in London.&nbsp; He had few friends there, and perhaps
those he had only disturbed without sweetening his solitude.&nbsp; One
of these was a Norwich friend, named Roger Kerrison, who shared lodgings
with him at 16, Millman Street, Bedford Row.&nbsp; Borrow confided in
Kerrison, and had written to him before leaving Norwich in terms of
perhaps unconsciously worked-up affection.&nbsp; But Borrow&rsquo;s
low spirits in London were more than Kerrison could stand.&nbsp; When
Borrow was proposing a short visit to Norwich his friend wrote to John
Thomas Borrow, suggesting that he should keep his brother there for
a time, or else return with him, for this reason.&nbsp; Borrow had &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;
threatened suicide, and unable to endure his fits of desperation Kerrison
had gone into separate lodgings: if his friend were to return in this
state and find himself alone he would &ldquo;again make some attempt
to destroy himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing was done, so far as is known,
and he did not commit suicide.&nbsp; It is a curious commentary on the
work of hack writers that this youth should have written as a note to
his translation of &ldquo;The Suicide&rsquo;s Grave,&rdquo; <a name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85">{85}</a>
that it was not translated for its sentiments but for its poetry; &ldquo;although
the path of human life is rough <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and
thorny, the mind may always receive consolation by looking forward to
the world to come.&nbsp; The mind which rejects a future state has to
thank itself for its utter misery and hopelessness.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
malady was youth, aggravated, the food reformer would say, by eating
fourteen pennyworth of bread and cheese at a meal, and certainly aggravated
by literary ambition.</p>
<p>Judging from the thirty-first chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
he was exceptionally sensitive at this time to all impressions&mdash;probably
both pleasant and unpleasant.&nbsp; He describes himself on his first
day gazing at the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s until his brain became dizzy,
and he thought the dome would fall and crush him, and he shrank within
himself, and struck yet deeper into the heart of the big city.&nbsp;
He stood on London Bridge dazed by the mighty motion of the waters and
the multitude of men and &ldquo;horses as large as elephants.&nbsp;
There I stood, just above the principal arch, looking through the balustrade
at the scene that presented itself&mdash;and such a scene!&nbsp; Towards
the left bank of the river, a forest of masts, thick and close, as far
as the eye could reach; spacious wharfs, surmounted with gigantic edifices;
and, far away, C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Castle, with its White Tower.&nbsp;
To the right, another forest of masts, and a maze of buildings, from
which, here and there, shot up to the sky chimneys taller than Cleopatra&rsquo;s
Needle, vomiting forth huge wreaths of that black smoke which forms
the canopy&mdash;occasionally a gorgeous one&mdash;of the more than
Babel city.&nbsp; Stretching before me, the troubled breast of the mighty
river, and, immediately below, the main whirlpool of the Thames&mdash;the
Maelstrom of the bulwarks of the middle arch&mdash;a grisly pool, which,
with its superabundance of horror, fascinated me.&nbsp; Who knows but
I should have leapt into its depths?&mdash;I have heard of such things&mdash;but
for a rather startling occurrence which broke the spell.&nbsp; As I
stood upon the bridge, gazing into the jaws of the <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>pool,
a small boat shot suddenly through the arch beneath my feet.&nbsp; There
were three persons in it; an oarsman in the middle, whilst a man and
woman sat at the stern.&nbsp; I shall never forget the thrill of horror
which went through me at this sudden apparition.&nbsp; What!&mdash;a
boat&mdash;a small boat&mdash;passing beneath that arch into yonder
roaring gulf!&nbsp; Yes, yes, down through that awful water-way, with
more than the swiftness of an arrow, shot the boat, or skiff, right
into the jaws of the pool.&nbsp; A monstrous breaker curls over the
prow&mdash;there is no hope; the boat is swamped, and all drowned in
that strangling vortex.&nbsp; No! the boat, which appeared to have the
buoyancy of a feather, skipped over the threatening horror, and the
next moment was out of danger, the boatman&mdash;a true boatman of Cockaigne,
that&mdash;elevating one of his skulls in sign of triumph, the man hallooing,
and the woman, a true Englishwoman that&mdash;of a certain class&mdash;waving
her shawl.&nbsp; Whether any one observed them save myself, or whether
the feat was a common one, I know not; but nobody appeared to take any
notice of them.&nbsp; As for myself, I was so excited, that I strove
to clamber up the balustrade of the bridge, in order to obtain a better
view of the daring adventurers.&nbsp; Before I could accomplish my design,
however, I felt myself seized by the body, and, turning my head, perceived
the old fruit-woman, who was clinging to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this very day, in his account, he first met the &ldquo;fiery,
enthusiastic and open-hearted,&rdquo; pleasure-loving young Irishman,
whom he calls Francis Ardry, who took him to the theatre and to &ldquo;the
strange and eccentric places of London,&rdquo; and no doubt helped to
give him the feeling of &ldquo;a regular Arabian Nights&rsquo; entertainment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
C. G. Leland <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87">{87}</a>
tells a story told to him by one who might have been the original of
Ardry.&nbsp; The story is the only independent <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>evidence
of Borrow&rsquo;s London life.&nbsp; This &ldquo;old gentleman&rdquo;
had been in youth for a long time the most intimate friend of George
Borrow, who was, he said, a very wild and eccentric youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
night, when skylarking about London, Borrow was pursued by the police,
as he wished to be, even as Panurge so planned as to be chased by the
night-watch.&nbsp; He was very tall and strong in those days, a trained
shoulder-hitter, and could run like a deer.&nbsp; He was hunted to the
Thames, and there they thought they had him.&nbsp; But the Romany Rye
made for the edge, and leaping into the wan water, like the Squyre in
the old ballad, swam to the other side, and escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is no wonder he &ldquo;did not like reviewing at all,&rdquo; especially
as he &ldquo;never could understand why reviews were instituted; works
of merit do not require to be reviewed, they can speak for themselves,
and require no praising; works of no merit at all will die of themselves,
they require no killing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He forgot &ldquo;The Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter,&rdquo; and he could not foresee the early fate of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
itself.&nbsp; He preferred manlier crime and riskier deception to reviewing.&nbsp;
As he read over the tales of rogues, he says, he became again what he
had been as a boy, a necessitarian, and could not &ldquo;imagine how,
taking all circumstances into consideration, these highwaymen, these
pickpockets, should have been anything else than highwaymen and pickpockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the days of such books as &ldquo;The Life and Extraordinary
Adventures of Samuel Denmore Hayward, denominated the Modern Macheath,
who suffered at the Old Bailey, on Tuesday, November 27, 1821, for the
Crime of Burglary,&rdquo; by Pierce Egan, embellished with a highly-finished
miniature by Mr. Smart, etched by T. R. Cruikshank; and a facsimile
of his handwriting.&nbsp; London, 1822.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a poor book, and now has descendants lower in the <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>social
scale.&nbsp; It pretends to give &ldquo;a most awful but useful lesson
to the rising generation&rdquo; by an account of the criminal whose
appearance as a boy &ldquo;was so superior to other boys of his class
in life as to have the look of a gentleman&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He naturally became a waiter, and &ldquo;though the situation did not
exactly accord with his ambition, it answered his purpose, because it
afforded him an opportunity of studying <i>character</i>, and being
in the company of gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was &ldquo;a generous high-minded
fellow towards the ladies,&rdquo; and became the fancy man of someone
else&rsquo;s mistress, living &ldquo;in the style of a gentleman <i>solely</i>
at the expense of the beautiful Miss ---.&rdquo;&nbsp; His &ldquo;unembarrassed
and gentlemanly&rdquo; behaviour survived even while he was being searched,
and he entered the chapel before execution &ldquo;with a firm step,
accompanied with the most gentlemanly deportment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The end
came nevertheless: &ldquo;Bowing to the sheriffs and the few persons
around him with all the manners of an accomplished gentleman, he ascended
the drop with a firmness that astonished everyone present; and resigned
his eventful life without scarce a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moral was the obvious one.&nbsp; &ldquo;His talents were his
misfortunes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The biographer pretends to believe that, though
the fellow lived in luxury, he must always have had a harassed mind;
the truth being that he himself would have had a harassed mind if he
had played so distinguished a part.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chequered life
of that young man,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;abounding with incidents and
facts almost incredible, and scarcely ever before practised with so
much art and delusion in so short a period, impressively points out
the danger arising from the possession of <i>great talents</i> when
perverted or <i>misapplied</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He points out, furthermore, how vice sinks before virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
instance, view the countenances of thieves, who are regaling themselves
on the most expensive liquors, laughing <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and
singing, how they are changed in an instant by the appearance of police
officers entering a room in search of them. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, &ldquo;let the youth of London bear in mind that honesty
is the best policy. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this happy country, where every individual has an opportunity
of raising himself to the highest office in the State, what might the
abilities of the unfortunate Hayward have accomplished for him if he
had not deviated from the paths of virtue?&nbsp; There is no place like
London in the world where a man of talents meets with so much encouragement
and liberality; his society is courted, and his presence gives a weight
to any company in which he appears; if supported by a good character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the crime was the thing.&nbsp; Of a different class was John
Hamilton Reynolds&rsquo; &ldquo;The Fancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book, published
in 1820, would have wholly delighted Borrow.&nbsp; I will quote the
footnote to the &ldquo;Lines to Philip Samson, the Brummagem Youth&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the great men of this age, in poetry, philosophy, or
pugilism, there is no one of such transcendent talent as Randall;&mdash;no
one who combines the finest natural powers with the most elegant and
finished acquired ones.&nbsp; The late Professor Stewart (who has left
the learned ring) is acknowledged to be clever in philosophy, but he
is a left-handed metaphysical fighter at best, and cannot be relied
upon at closing with his subject.&nbsp; Lord Byron is a powerful poet,
with a mind weighing fourteen stone; but he is too sombre and bitter,
and is apt to lose his temper.&nbsp; Randall has no defect, or at best
he has not yet betrayed the appearance of one.&nbsp; His figure is remarkable,
when <i>peeled</i>, for its statue-like beauty, and nothing can equal
the alacrity with which he uses either hand, or the coolness with which
he <i>receives</i>.&nbsp; His goodness on his legs, Boxiana (a Lord
Eldon in the skill and caution of his judgments) assures us, <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>is
unequalled.&nbsp; He doubles up an opponent, as a friend lately declared,
as easily as though he were picking a flower or pinching a girl&rsquo;s
cheek.&nbsp; He is about to fight Jos.&nbsp; Hudson, who challenged
him lately at the Royal Tennis Court.&nbsp; Randall declared, that &lsquo;though
he had declined fighting, he would <i>accommodate Joshua</i>&rsquo;;
a kind and benevolent reply, which does equal honour to his head and
heart.&nbsp; The editor of this little volume, like Goldfinch in the
&lsquo;Road to Ruin,&rsquo; &lsquo;would not stay away for a thousand
pounds.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has already looked about for a tall horse and
a taxed cart, and he has some hopes of compassing a drab coat and a
white hat, for he has no wish to appear singular at such scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reynolds, like Borrow, was an admirer of Byron, and he anticipated
Borrow in the spirit of his remark to John Murray that the author&rsquo;s
trade was contemptible compared with the jockey&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At that
moment it was unquestionably so.&nbsp; Soon even reviewing failed.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Universal Review&rdquo; died at the beginning of 1825, and
Borrow seems to have quarrelled with Phillips because some Germans had
found the German of his translation as unintelligible as he had found
the publisher&rsquo;s English.&nbsp; He had nothing left but his physical
strength, his translations, and a very little money.&nbsp; When he had
come down to half-a-crown, he says, he thought of accepting a patriotic
Armenian&rsquo;s invitation to translate an Armenian work into English;
only the Armenian went away.</p>
<h2><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>CHAPTER
XIII&mdash;&ldquo;JOSEPH SELL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Then, on a fair day on Blackheath, he met Mr. Petulengro again who
said he looked ill and offered him the loan of &pound;50, which he would
not accept, nor his invitation to join the band.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp confidently
gives the date of May 12 to this incident because that is the day of
the annual fair.&nbsp; Then seeing an advertisement: &ldquo;A Novel
or Tale is much wanted,&rdquo; outside a bookseller&rsquo;s shop, Borrow
wrote &ldquo;The Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell, the Great Traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did he?&nbsp; Dr. Knapp thinks he did, but that the story had another
name, and is to be sought for in such collections of 1825 and 1826 as
&ldquo;Watt&rsquo;s Literary Souvenir.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Borrow speaks
of the materials of it having come from his own brain, and as Dr. Knapp
says he could not invent, why not conclude that it was autobiographical?</p>
<p>There is no evidence except that the account sounds true, and might
very well be true.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp thinks that he wrote this book, and
that he did many other things which he said he did, because wherever
there is any evidence it corroborates Borrow&rsquo;s statements except
in small matters of names and dates.&nbsp; In the earlier version of
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; represented by a manuscript and a proof, &ldquo;Ardry&rdquo;
is &ldquo;Arden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jasper&rdquo; is &ldquo;Ambrose,&rdquo;
and the question &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; is answered by &ldquo;Thurtell,&rdquo;
instead of a blank.&nbsp; Now there was an Ambrose Smith whom Borrow
knew, and Thurtell was such a man as he describes in search of a place
for the fight.&nbsp; Therefore, Dr. Knapp would be inclined to say that
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Borrow
did know a young man named Arden.&nbsp; And, furthermore, as Isopel
is called Elizabeth in that earlier version, Isopel did exist, but her
name was Elizabeth: she was, says Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;really an
East Anglian road girl&rdquo; (not a Gypsy) &ldquo;of the finest type,
known to the Boswells and remembered not many years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And speaking of Isopel&mdash;there is a story still to be heard at Long
Melford of a girl &ldquo;who lived on the green and ran away with the
Gypsy,&rdquo; in about the year 1825.&nbsp; With this may possibly be
connected another story: of a young painter of dogs and horses who was
living at Melford in 1805 and seduced either one or two sisters of the
warden of the hospital or almshouse, and had two illegitimate children,
one at any rate a girl.&nbsp; The Great House was one used, but not
built, for a workhouse: it stood near the vicarage at Melford, but has
now disappeared, and apparently its records with it.</p>
<p>Borrow did not invent, says Knapp, which is absurd.&nbsp; Some of
his reappearances, recognitions and coincidences must be inventions.&nbsp;
The postillion&rsquo;s tale must be largely invention.&nbsp; But it
is not fair or necessary to retort as Hindes Groome did: &ldquo;Is the
Man in Black then also a reality, and the Reverend Mr. Platitude?&nbsp;
In other words, did Tractarianism exist in 1825, eight years before
it was engendered by Keble&rsquo;s sermon?&rdquo;&nbsp; For Borrow was
unscrupulous or careless about time and place.&nbsp; But it is fair
and necessary to say, as Hindes Groome did, that some of the unverities
in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; are &ldquo;probably
due to forgetfulness,&rdquo; the rest to &ldquo;love of posing, but
much more to an honest desire to produce an amusing and interesting
book.&rdquo; <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a">{93a}</a>&nbsp;
Borrow was a great admirer of the &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b">{93b}</a>
of Vidocq,&rdquo; principal agent of the French police till 1827&mdash;now
proprietor of the paper <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>manufactory
at St. Maude,&rdquo; and formerly showman, soldier, galley slave, and
highwayman.&nbsp; Of this book the editor says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not our province or intention to enter into a discussion
of the veracity of Vidocq&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo;: be they true
or false, were they purely fiction from the first chapter to the last,
they would, from fertility of invention, knowledge of human nature,
and easy style, rank only second to the novels of Le Sage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly with books such as this in his mind that Borrow
composed his autobiography, but it goes so much deeper that it is at
every point a revelation, usually of actual events and emotions, always
of thought and taste.&nbsp; In these &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; of Vidocq
there is a man named Christian, or Caron, with a reputation for removing
charms cast on animals, and he takes Vidocq to his Gypsy friends at
Malines:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having traversed the city, we stopped in the Faubourg de Louvain,
before a wretched looking house with blackened walls, furrowed with
wide crevices, and many bundles of straw as substitutes for window glasses.&nbsp;
It was midnight, and I had time to make my observations by the moonlight,
for more than half an hour elapsed before the door was opened by one
of the most hideous old hags I ever saw in my life.&nbsp; We were then
introduced to a long room where thirty persons of both sexes were indiscriminately
smoking and drinking, mingling in strange and licentious positions.&nbsp;
Under their blue loose frocks, ornamented with red embroidery, the men
wore blue velvet waistcoats with silver buttons, like the Andalusian
muleteers; the clothing of the women was all of one bright colour; there
were some ferocious countenances amongst them, but yet they were all
feasting.&nbsp; The monotonous sound of a drum, mingled with the howling
of two dogs tied under the table, accompanied the strange songs, which
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I
mistook for a funeral psalm.&nbsp; The smoke of tobacco and wood which
filled this den, scarcely allowed me to perceive in the midst of the
room a woman, who, adorned with a scarlet turban, was performing a wild
dance with the most wanton postures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Knapp, on insufficient evidence, attributes the translation to
Borrow.&nbsp; But certainly Borrow might have incorporated this passage
in his own work almost word for word without justifying a charge either
of plagiarism or untruth.&nbsp; Other men had written fiction as if
it were autobiography; he was writing autobiography as if it were fiction;
he used his own life as a subject for fiction.&nbsp; Ford crudely said
that Borrow &ldquo;coloured up and poetised&rdquo; his adventures.</p>
<h2><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>CHAPTER
XIV&mdash;OUT OF LONDON</h2>
<p>If Borrow is taken literally, he was at Blackheath on May 12, 1825,
sold his &ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rdquo; on the 20th, and left London
on the 22nd.&nbsp; &ldquo;For some months past I had been far from well,
and my original indisposition, brought on partly by the peculiar atmosphere
of the Big City, partly by anxiety of mind, had been much increased
by the exertions which I had been compelled to make during the last
few days.&nbsp; I felt that, were I to remain where I was, I should
die, or become a confirmed valetudinarian.&nbsp; I would go forth into
the country, travelling on foot, and, by exercise and inhaling pure
air, endeavour to recover my health, leaving my subsequent movements
to be determined by Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says definitely in the appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
that he fled from London and hack-authorship for &ldquo;fear of a consumption.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Walking on an unknown road out of London the &ldquo;poor thin lad&rdquo;
felt tired at the ninth milestone, and thought of putting up at an inn
for the night, but instead took the coach to ---, <i>i.e.</i>, Amesbury.</p>
<p>The remaining ninety chapters of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Romany Rye&rdquo; are filled by the story of the next four months of
Borrow&rsquo;s life and by stories told to him during that period.&nbsp;
The preceding fifty-seven chapters had sufficed for twenty-two years.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The novelty&rdquo; of the new itinerant life, says Mr. Thomas
Seccombe, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96">{96}</a> &ldquo;graved
every <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>incident
in the most vivid possible manner upon the writer&rsquo;s recollection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After walking for four days northwest from Salisbury he met an author,
a rich man who was continually touching things to avert the evil chance,
and with him he stayed the night.&nbsp; On the next day he bought a
pony and cart from the tinker, Jack Slingsby, with the purpose of working
on the tinker&rsquo;s beat and making horse-shoes.&nbsp; After some
days he was visited down in a Shropshire dingle by a Gypsy girl, who
poisoned him at the instigation of his enemy, old Mrs. Herne.&nbsp;
Only the accidental appearance of the Welsh preacher, Peter Williams,
saved him.&nbsp; Years afterwards, in 1854, it may be mentioned here,
he told a friend in Cornwall that his fits of melancholy were due to
the poison of a Gypsy crone.&nbsp; He spent a week in the company of
the preacher and his wife, and was about to cross the Welsh border with
them when Jasper Petulengro reappeared, and he turned back.&nbsp; Jasper
told him that Mrs. Herne had hanged herself out of disappointment at
his escape from her poison.&nbsp; This made it a point of honour for
Jasper to fight Borrow, whose bloody face satisfied him in half an hour:
he even offered Borrow his sister Ursula for a wife.&nbsp; Borrow refused,
and settled alone in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, which was perhaps Mumber
Lane, five miles from Willenhall in Staffordshire. <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97">{97}</a>&nbsp;
Here he fought the Flaming Tinman, who had driven Slingsby out of his
beat.&nbsp; The Tinman brought with him his wife and Isopel Berners,
the tall fair-haired girl who struck Borrow first with her beauty and
then with her right arm.&nbsp; Isopel stayed with Borrow after the defeat
of the Tinman, and their companionship in the dingle fills a very large
part of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; with
interruptions and diversions from the Man in Black, the gin-drinking
priest, who was then at work undermining the Protestantism <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of
old England.&nbsp; Isopel stood by him when suffering from &ldquo;indescribable
horror,&rdquo; and recommended &ldquo;ale, and let it be strong.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow makes her evidently inclined to marry him; for example, when
she says that if she goes to America she will go alone &ldquo;unless&mdash;unless
that should happen which is not likely,&rdquo; and when he says &ldquo;.
. . If I had the power I would make you queen of something better than
the dingle&mdash;Queen of China.&nbsp; Come, let us have tea,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;&lsquo;Something less would content me,&rsquo; said Belle,
sighing, as she rose to prepare our evening meal&rdquo;&mdash;and when
at the postillion&rsquo;s suggestion of a love affair, she buries her
face in her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;She would sigh, too,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;as I recounted the many slights and degradations I had received
at the hands of ferocious publishers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In one place Borrow
says: &ldquo;I am, of course, nothing to her, but she is mistaken in
thinking she is nothing to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow represents himself
as tyrannically imposing himself upon the girl as teacher of Armenian,
enlivening the instruction with the one mild <i>double entendre</i>,
of &ldquo;I decline a mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; At times they seem on terms
of as perfect good fellowship as ever was, with a touch of post-matrimonial
indifference; but Isopel had fits of weeping and Borrow of listlessness.&nbsp;
Borrow was uncommonly fond of prophetic tragic irony.&nbsp; As he made
Thurtell unconsciously suggest to the reader his own execution, so he
makes Isopel say one day when she is going a journey: &ldquo;I shall
return once more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lavengro starts but thinks no more of
it.</p>
<p>While she was away he began to think: &ldquo;I began to think, &lsquo;What
was likely to be the profit of my present way of life; the living in
dingles, making pony and donkey shoes, conversing with Gypsy-women under
hedges, and extracting from them their odd secrets?&rsquo;&nbsp; What
was likely to be the profit of such a kind of life, even should it continue
for a length of time?&mdash;a supposition not very probable, for I was
earning nothing to support me, and the funds with <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>which
I had entered upon this life were gradually disappearing.&nbsp; I was
living, it is true, not unpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of heaven;
but, upon the whole, was I not sadly misspending my time?&nbsp; Surely
I was; and, as I looked back, it appeared to me that I had always been
doing so.&nbsp; What had been the profit of the tongues which I had
learned? had they ever assisted me in the day of hunger?&nbsp; No, no!
it appeared to me that I had always misspent my time, save in one instance,
when by a desperate effort I had collected all the powers of my imagination,
and written the &lsquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rsquo;; but even when I wrote
the &lsquo;Life of Sell,&rsquo; was I not in a false position?&nbsp;
Provided I had not misspent my time, would it have been necessary to
make that effort, which, after all, had only enabled me to leave London,
and wander about the country for a time?&nbsp; But could I, taking all
circumstances into consideration, have done better than I had?&nbsp;
With my peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have pursued with advantage
the profession to which my respectable parents had endeavoured to bring
me up?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I could not, and that the hand of
necessity had guided me from my earliest years, until the present night
in which I found myself seated in the dingle, staring on the brands
of the fire.&nbsp; But ceasing to think of the past which, as irrecoverably
gone, it was useless to regret, even were there cause to regret it,
what should I do in future?&nbsp; Should I write another book like the
&lsquo;Life of Joseph Sell;&rsquo; take it to London, and offer it to
a publisher?&nbsp; But when I reflected on the grisly sufferings which
I had undergone whilst engaged in writing the &lsquo;Life of Sell,&rsquo;
I shrank from the idea of a similar attempt; moreover, I doubted whether
I possessed the power to write a similar work&mdash;whether the materials
for the life of another Sell lurked within the recesses of my brain?&nbsp;
Had I not better become in reality what I had hitherto been merely playing
at&mdash;a tinker or a Gypsy?&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>But
I soon saw that I was not fitted to become either in reality.&nbsp;
It was much more agreeable to play the Gypsy or the tinker, than to
become either in reality.&nbsp; I had seen enough of gypsying and tinkering
to be convinced of that.&nbsp; All of a sudden the idea of tilling the
soil came into my head; tilling the soil was a healthful and noble pursuit!
but my idea of tilling the soil had no connection with Britain; for
I could only expect to till the soil in Britain as a serf.&nbsp; I thought
of tilling it in America, in which it was said there was plenty of wild,
unclaimed land, of which any one, who chose to clear it of its trees,
might take possession.&nbsp; I figured myself in America, in an immense
forest, clearing the land destined, by my exertions, to become a fruitful
and smiling plain.&nbsp; Methought I heard the crash of the huge trees
as they fell beneath my axe; and then I bethought me that a man was
intended to marry&mdash;I ought to marry; and if I married, where was
I likely to be more happy as a husband and a father than in America,
engaged in tilling the ground?&nbsp; I fancied myself in America, engaged
in tilling the ground, assisted by an enormous progeny.&nbsp; Well,
why not marry, and go and till the ground in America?&nbsp; I was young,
and youth was the time to marry in, and to labour in.&nbsp; I had the
use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is true, were rather dull from
early study, and from writing the &lsquo;Life of Joseph Sell&rsquo;;
but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were not bleared.&nbsp;
I felt my arms, and thighs, and teeth&mdash;they were strong and sound
enough; so now was the time to labour, to marry, eat strong flesh, and
beget strong children&mdash;the power of doing all this would pass away
with youth, which was terribly transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that
a time would come when my eyes would be bleared, and perhaps, sightless;
my arms and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my teeth would shake
in my jaws, even supposing they did not drop out.&nbsp; No going a wooing
then&mdash;no labouring&mdash;<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>no
eating strong flesh, and begetting lusty children then; and I bethought
me how, when all this should be, I should bewail the days of my youth
as misspent, provided I had not in them founded for myself a home, and
begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when I could
not take care of myself; and thinking of these things, I became sadder
and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the fire till my eyes closed in
a doze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, before going to bed, he filled the kettle in case Isopel should
return during the night.&nbsp; He fell asleep and was dreaming hard
and hearing the sound of wheels in his dream &ldquo;grating amidst sand
and gravel,&rdquo; when suddenly he awoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;The next moment
I was awake, and found myself sitting up in my tent; there was a glimmer
of light through the canvas caused by the fire; a feeling of dread came
over me, which was perhaps natural, on starting suddenly from one&rsquo;s
sleep in that wild lone place; I half imagined that some one was nigh
the tent; the idea made me rather uncomfortable, and to dissipate it
I lifted up the canvas of the door and peeped out, and, lo! I had an
indistinct view of a tall figure standing by the tent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who
is that?&rsquo; said I, whilst I felt my blood rush to my heart.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; said the voice of Isopel Berners; &lsquo;you
little expected me, I dare say; well, sleep on, I do not wish to disturb
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But I was expecting you,&rsquo; said I, recovering
myself, &lsquo;as you may see by the fire and the kettle.&nbsp; I will
be with you in a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung
off, I came out of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who was
standing beside her cart, I said&mdash;&lsquo;Just as I was about to
retire to rest I thought it possible that you might come to-night, and
got everything in readiness for you.&nbsp; Now, sit down by the fire
whilst I lead the donkey and cart to the place where you stay; I will
unharness the animal, and presently come and join you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I need not <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>trouble
you,&rsquo; said Isopel; &lsquo;I will go myself and see after my things.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;We will go together,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and then return and
have some tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Isopel made no objection, and in about half
an hour we had arranged everything at her quarters.&nbsp; I then hastened
and prepared tea.&nbsp; Presently Isopel rejoined me, bringing her stool;
she had divested herself of her bonnet, and her hair fell over her shoulders;
she sat down, and I poured out the beverage, handing her a cup.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you made a long journey to-night?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
very long one,&rsquo; replied Belle,&rsquo; I have come nearly twenty
miles since six o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe I heard
you coming in my sleep,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;did the dogs above bark
at you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Isopel, &lsquo;very violently;
did you think of me in your sleep?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;I was thinking of Ursula and something she had told me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;When and where was that?&rsquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yesterday
evening,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;beneath the dingle hedge.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then you were talking with her beneath the hedge?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but only upon Gypsy matters.&nbsp;
Do you know, Belle, that she has just been married to Sylvester, so
you need not think that she and I . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She and
you are quite at liberty to sit where you please,&rsquo; said Isopel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However, young man,&rsquo; she continued, dropping her tone,
which she had slightly raised, &lsquo;I believe what you said, that
you were merely talking about Gypsy matters, and also what you were
going to say, if it was, as I suppose, that she and you had no particular
acquaintance.&rsquo;&nbsp; Isopel was now silent for some time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo;
said Belle, &lsquo;how exceedingly kind it was of you to get everything
in readiness for me, though you did not know that I should come.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had a presentiment that you would come,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but
you forget that I have prepared the kettle for you before, though it
was true I was then certain that you would come.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
had not forgotten your doing so, young man,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;but
I was beginning to think that you <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>were
utterly selfish, caring for nothing but the gratification of your own
strange whims.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am very fond of having my own way,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;but utterly selfish I am not, as I dare say I shall frequently
prove to you.&nbsp; You will often find the kettle boiling when you
come home.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not heated by you,&rsquo; said Isopel,
with a sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;By whom else?&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;surely
you are not thinking of driving me away?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
as much right here as myself,&rsquo; said Isopel, &lsquo;as I have told
you before; but I must be going myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;we can go together; to tell you the truth, I am rather
tired of this place.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Our paths must be separate,&rsquo;
said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Separate,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what do you
mean?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let you go alone, I shall go with you; and
you know the road is as free to me as to you; besides, you can&rsquo;t
think of parting company with me, considering how much you would lose
by doing so; remember that you scarcely know anything of the Armenian
language; now, to learn Armenian from me would take you twenty years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle faintly smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;take
another cup of tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle took another cup of tea, and
yet another; we had some indifferent conversation, after which I arose
and gave her donkey a considerable feed of corn.&nbsp; Belle thanked
me, shook me by the hand, and then went to her own tabernacle, and I
returned to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He torments her once more with Armenian and makes her speak in such
a way that the reader sees&mdash;what he himself did not then see&mdash;that
she was too sick with love for banter.&nbsp; She bade him farewell with
the same transparent significance on the next day, when he was off early
to a fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I waved my hand towards her.&nbsp; She slowly
lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away and never saw Isopel Berners
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; That night as he was going home he said: &ldquo;Isopel
Berners is waiting for me, and the first word that I shall hear from
her lips is that she has made up her mind.&nbsp; We shall go to America,
and be so happy together.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sent <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>him
a letter of farewell, and he could not follow her, he would not try,
lest if he overtook her she should despise him for running after her.</p>
<p>I can only say that it is an extraordinary love-making, but then
all love-making, when truthfully reported, is extraordinary.&nbsp; There
can be little doubt, therefore, that this episode is truthfully reported.&nbsp;
Borrow himself has made a comment on himself and women through the mouth
of Jasper.&nbsp; The Gypsy had overheard him talking to his sister Ursula
for three hours under a hedge, and his opinion was: &ldquo;I begin to
think you care for nothing in this world but old words and strange stories.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When, afterwards, invited to kiss the same Ursula, he refused, &ldquo;having,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;inherited from nature a considerable fund of modesty,
to which was added no slight store acquired in the course of my Irish
education,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> at the age of twelve.</p>
<p>After Isopel had gone he bought a fine horse with the help of a loan
of &pound;50 from Jasper, and travelled with it across England, meeting
adventures and hearing of others.&nbsp; He was for a time bookkeeper
at a coaching inn, still with some pounds in his purse.&nbsp; At Horncastle,
which he mentions more than once by name, he sold the horse for &pound;150.&nbsp;
As the fair at Horncastle lasted from the 11th to the 21st of August,
the date of this last adventure is almost exactly fixed.&nbsp; Here
the book ends.</p>

XV&mdash;AN EARLY PORTRAIT</h2>
<p>At the end of these travels Borrow had turned twenty-two.&nbsp; His
brother John painted his portrait, but it has disappeared, and Borrow
himself, as if fearing lest no adequate picture of him should remain,
took pains to leave the material for one.&nbsp; It is a peculiarity
of his books that people whom he meets and converses with often remark
on his appearance.&nbsp; He must himself have been tolerably familiar
with it and used to comment on it.&nbsp; He told his father that a lady
thought him like Alfieri&rsquo;s Saul; at a later date Haydon, the painter,
said he would &ldquo;make a capital Pharaoh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Years before,
when he was a boy, Petulengro recognised him after a long absence, because
there was something in his face to prevent people from forgetting him.&nbsp;
Mrs. Herne, his Gypsy enemy, praised him for his &ldquo;singular and
outrageous ugliness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was lean, long-limbed and tall,
having reached his full height of six-feet-two probably before the end
of his teens; he had plenty of room to fill before becoming a big man,
and yet he was already powerful and clearly destined to be a big man.&nbsp;
His hair had for some time been rapidly becoming grey, and was soon
to be altogether white: it had once been black, and his strongly-marked
eyebrows were still dark brown.&nbsp; His face was oval and inclining
to olive in complexion; his nose rounded, but not too large; his mouth
good and well-moulded; his eyes dark brown and noticeable indescribably,
either through their light or through the curve of the eyelids across
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a flash about <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>that
eye of yours,&rdquo; says the old apple woman, and it is she that notices
the &ldquo;blob of foam&rdquo; on his lips, while he is musing aloud,
exclaiming &ldquo;Necessity!&rdquo; and cracking his finger-joints.&nbsp;
He had an Irish look, or so thought his London acquaintance, Ardry.&nbsp;
He looked &ldquo;rather wild&rdquo; at times and he had a way of clenching
his fist when he was determined not to be put upon, as the bullying
coachman found who had said: &ldquo;One-and-ninepence, sir, or the things
which you have brought with you will be taken away from you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yet he had small hands for his size and &ldquo;long white fingers,&rdquo;
which &ldquo;would just serve for the business,&rdquo; said the thimble-rigger.&nbsp;
Though ready to hit people when he is angry, &ldquo;a more civil and
pleasant-spoken person than yourself,&rdquo; says Ursula, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
be found.&rdquo;&nbsp; His own opinion was &ldquo;that he was not altogether
deficient in courage and in propriety of behaviour. . . . That his appearance
was not particularly against him, his face not being like that of a
convicted pickpocket, nor his gait resembling that of a fox that has
lost his tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as a &ldquo;poor thin lad&rdquo; that
he commends himself to us, through the mouth of the old apple woman,
at his setting out from London, but as he gets on he shows himself &ldquo;an
excellent pedestrian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already in London he has made one or two favourable impressions,
as when he convinces the superb waiter that he is &ldquo;accustomed
to claret.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is upon the roads that he wishes to shine.&nbsp;
When the Man in Black asks how he knows him, he answers that &ldquo;Gypsies
have various ways of obtaining information.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later on, he
makes the Man in Black address him as &ldquo;Zingaro.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
impresses the commercial traveller as &ldquo;a confounded sensible young
fellow, and not at all opinionated,&rdquo; and Lord Whitefeather as
a highwayman in disguise, and the Gypsies as one who never spoke a bad
word and never did a bad thing.&nbsp; This is his most impressive moment,
when the jockey discovers <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>that
he is the Romany Rye and tells him there is scarcely a part of England
where he has not heard the name of the Romany Rye mentioned by the Gypsies.&nbsp;
Here he makes another praise him.&nbsp; Now let him mount the fine horse
he has bought with &pound;50 borrowed from a Gypsy, and is about to
sell for &pound;150 at Horncastle Fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked
out in his borrowed finery, really looked better by a large sum of money
than on any former occasion.&nbsp; Making my way out of the yard of
the inn, I was instantly in the principal street of the town, up and
down which an immense number of horses were being exhibited, some led,
and others with riders.&nbsp; &lsquo;A wonderful small quantity of good
horses in the fair this time!&rsquo; I heard a stout jockey-looking
individual say, who was staring up the street with his side towards
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloo, young fellow!&rsquo; said he, a few moments
after I had passed, &lsquo;whose horse is that?&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I
want to look at him!&rsquo;&nbsp; Though confident that he was addressing
himself to me, I took no notice, remembering the advice of the ostler,
and proceeded up the street.&nbsp; My horse possessed a good walking
step; but walking, as the reader knows, was not his best pace, which
was the long trot, at which I could not well exercise him in the street,
on account of the crowd of men and animals; however, as he walked along,
I could easily perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst
those who, by their jockey dress and general appearance, I imagined
to be connoisseurs; I heard various calls to stop, to none of which
I paid the slightest attention.&nbsp; In a few minutes I found myself
out of the town, when, turning round for the purpose of returning, I
found I had been followed by several of the connoisseur-looking individuals,
whom I had observed in the fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now would be the time
for a display,&rsquo; thought I; and looking around me I observed two
five-barred gates, one on each side of the road, and <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>fronting
each other.&nbsp; Turning my horse&rsquo;s head to one, I pressed my
heels to his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an encouraging cry,
whereupon the animal cleared the gate in a twinkling.&nbsp; Before he
had advanced ten yards in the field to which the gate opened, I had
turned him round, and again giving him cry and rein, I caused him to
leap back again into the road, and still allowing him head, I made him
leap the other gate; and forthwith turning him round, I caused him to
leap once more into the road, where he stood proudly tossing his head,
as much as to say, &lsquo;What more?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A fine horse!
a capital horse!&rsquo; said several of the connoisseurs.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
do you ask for him?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Too much for any of you to pay,&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A horse like this is intended for other kind of
customers than any of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you know that?&rsquo;
said one; the very same person whom I had heard complaining in the street
of the paucity of good horses in the fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, let us
know what you ask for him?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A hundred and fifty pounds!&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;neither more nor less.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you call
that a great price?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I thought
you would have asked double that amount!&nbsp; You do yourself injustice,
young man.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I do,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but
that&rsquo;s my affair; I do not choose to take more.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish you would let me get into the saddle,&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;the
horse knows you, and therefore shows to more advantage; but I should
like to see how he would move under me, who am a stranger.&nbsp; Will
you let me get into the saddle, young man?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;I will not let you get into the saddle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lest you should be
a Yorkshireman,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and should run away with the horse.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yorkshire?&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;I am from Suffolk; silly
Suffolk&mdash;so you need not be afraid of my running away with the
horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! if that&rsquo;s the case,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;I should be afraid that the horse would run away with you;
so I will by no means let you mount.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you let
me look in his mouth?&rsquo; said <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but I tell you,
he&rsquo;s apt to bite.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He can scarcely be a worse
bite than his master,&rsquo; said the man, looking into the horse&rsquo;s
mouth; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s four off.&nbsp; I say, young man, will you
warrant this horse?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I
never warrant horses; the horses that I ride can always warrant themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wish you would let me speak a word to you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just come aside.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rsquo; said he,
in a half whisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rsquo; said he, placing his hand upon
the pommel of the saddle and looking up in my face, &lsquo;and I think
I can find you a customer.&nbsp; If you would take a hundred, I think
my lord would purchase it, for he has sent me about the fair to look
him up a horse, by which he could hope to make an honest penny.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and could he not make an honest penny,
and yet give me the price I ask?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said
the go-between, &lsquo;a hundred and fifty pounds is as much as the
animal is worth, or nearly so; and my lord, do you see . . .&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I see no reason at all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;why I should sell
the animal for less than he is worth, in order that his lordship may
be benefited by him; so that if his lordship wants to make an honest
penny, he must find some person who would consider the disadvantage
of selling him a horse for less than it is worth, as counterbalanced
by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should never do; but I
can&rsquo;t be wasting my time here.&nbsp; I am going back to the .
. ., where if you, or any person, are desirous of purchasing the horse,
you must come within the next half-hour, or I shall probably not feel
disposed to sell him at all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Another word, young
man,&rsquo; said the jockey; but without staying to hear what he had
to say, I put the horse to his best trot, and re-entering the town,
and threading my way as well as I could through the press, I returned
to the yard of the inn, where, dismounting, I stood still, holding the
horse by the bridle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>As
no one else troubled to paint Borrow either at Horncastle or any other
place, and as he took advantage of the fact to such purpose, I must
leave this portrait as it is, only I shall remind the reader that it
is not a photograph but a portrait of the painter.&nbsp; A little time
ago this painter was a consumptive-looking literary hack, and is still
a philologist, with eyes a bit dim from too much reading, and subject
to frantic melancholy;&mdash;a liker of solitude and of men and women
who do not disturb it, but a man accustomed to men and very well able
to deal with them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>CHAPTER
XVI&mdash;THE VEILED PERIOD</h2>
<p>The last words of &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; narrative are: &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally
from India.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
his way of giving impressiveness to the &ldquo;veiled period&rdquo;
of the following seven or eight years, for the benefit of those who
had read &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo;
and had been allured by the hints of earlier travel.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The
Zincali&rdquo; he has spoken of seeing &ldquo;Gypsies of various lands,
Russian, Hungarian and Turkish; and also the legitimate children of
most countries of the world&rdquo;: of being &ldquo;in the shop of an
Armenian at Constantinople,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lately at Janina in Albania.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; he had spoken of &ldquo;an acquaintance
of mine, a Tartar Khan.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had described strange things,
and said: &ldquo;This is not the first instance in which it has been
my lot to verify the wisdom of the saying, that truth is sometimes wilder
than fiction;&rdquo; he had met Baron Taylor and reminded the reader
of other meetings &ldquo;in the street or the desert, the brilliant
hall or amongst Bedouin haimas, at Novgorod or Stambul.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Before 1833 he had been in Paris and Madrid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
everywhere,&rdquo; he said to the simple company at a Welsh inn.&nbsp;
Speaking to Colonel Napier in 1839 at Seville, he said that he had picked
up the Gypsy tongue &ldquo;some years ago in Moultan,&rdquo; and he
gave the impression that he had visited most parts of the East.</p>
<p>A little too much has been made of this &ldquo;veiled period,&rdquo;
not by Borrow, but by others.&nbsp; It would have been fair to surmise
that if he chose not to write about this period of <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>his
life, either there was very little in it, or there was something in
it which he was unwilling&mdash;perhaps ashamed&mdash;to disclose; and
what has been discovered suggests that he was in an unsettled state&mdash;writing
to please himself and perhaps also the booksellers, travelling a little
and perhaps meeting some of the adventures which he crammed into those
few months of 1825, suffering from &ldquo;the horrors&rdquo; either
in solitude or with no confidant but his mother.</p>
<p>Borrow himself took no great pains to preserve the veil.&nbsp; For
instance, in the preface to his translation of &ldquo;Y Bardd Cwsg&rdquo;
in 1860, he says that it was made &ldquo;in the year 1830 at the request
of a little Welsh bookseller of his acquaintance&rdquo; in Smithfield.</p>
<p>In 1826 he was in Norwich: the &ldquo;Romantic Ballads&rdquo; were
published there, and in May he received a letter from Allan Cunningham,
whose cheery commendatory verses ushered in the book.&nbsp; The letter
suggests that Borrow was indolent from apathy.&nbsp; The book had no
success or notice, which Knapp puts down to his not sending out presentation
copies.&nbsp; &ldquo;I judge, however,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that he
sent one to Walter Scott, and that that busy writer forgot to acknowledge
the courtesy.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s lifelong hostility to Scott would
thus be accounted for;&rdquo; but the hostility is his reason for supposing
that the copy was sent.&nbsp; Some time afterwards, in 1826, he was
at 26, Bryanstone Street, Portman Square, and was to sit for the artist,
B. R. Haydon, before going off to the South of France.&nbsp; If he went,
he may have paid the visits to Paris, Bayonne, Italy and Spain, which
he alludes to in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;; he may, as Dr. Knapp
suggests, have covered the ground of Murtagh&rsquo;s alleged travels
in &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; and have been at Pau, with Quesada&rsquo;s
army marching to Pamplona, at Torrelodones, and at Seville.&nbsp; But
in a letter to the Bible Society in 1838 he spoke of his earlier acquaintance
with Spain being confined almost entirely to Madrid.&nbsp; It may <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>be
true, as he says in &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; that &ldquo;once in the
south of France, when he was weary, hungry, and penniless, he observed
one of these patterans or Gypsy trails, and, following the direction
pointed out, arrived at the resting place of some Gypsies, who received
him with kindness and hospitality on the faith of no other word of recommendation
than patteran.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be true that he wandered in Italy,
and rested at nightfall by a kiln &ldquo;about four leagues from Genoa.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But by April, 1827, he must have been back in Norwich, according to
Knapp, to see Marshland Shales at the fair.&nbsp; Knapp gives certain
proof that he was there between September and December.&nbsp; Thereafter,
if Knapp was right, he was translating Vidocq&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoirs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1829 again he was in London, at 17, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury,
and was projecting with John Bowring a collection of &ldquo;Songs of
Scandinavia.&rdquo;&nbsp; He applied for work to the Highland Society
and to the British Museum, in 1830.&nbsp; In that summer he was at 7,
Museum Street, Bloomsbury.&nbsp; He was not satisfied with his work
or its remuneration.&nbsp; He thought of entering the French Army, of
going to Greece, of getting work, with Bowring&rsquo;s help, under the
Belgian Government.&nbsp; His name &ldquo;had been down for several
years&rdquo; for the purchase of a commission in the English Army, and
Bowring offered to recommend him to &ldquo;a corps in one of the Eastern
Colonies,&rdquo; where he could perfect his Arabic and Persian.&nbsp;
In 1842 he wrote a letter to Bowring, printed by Mr. Walling, asking
for &ldquo;as many of the papers and manuscripts which I left at yours
some twelve years ago, as you can find,&rdquo; and for advice and a
loan of books, and promising that Murray will send a copy of &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo; to &ldquo;my oldest, I may say my <i>only</i>
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; But whatever Bowring&rsquo;s help, Borrow was &ldquo;drifting
on the sea of the world, and likely to be so,&rdquo; and especially
hurt because of the figure he must cut in the eyes of his own people.&nbsp;
Was it now, or when he <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>was
bookkeeper at the inn in 1825, that he saw so much of the ways of commercial
travellers? <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114">{114}</a></p>
<p>It is not necessary to quote from the metrical translations, probably
of this period, &ldquo;selections from a huge, undigested mass of translation,
accumulated during several years devoted to philological pursuits,&rdquo;
published in &ldquo;The Targum&rdquo; of 1835.&nbsp; They were made
from originals in the Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Tartar, Tibetian,
Chinese, Mandchou, Russian, Malo-Russian, Polish, Finnish, Anglo-Saxon,
Ancient Norse, Suabian, German, Dutch, Danish, Ancient Danish, Swedish,
Ancient Irish, Irish, Gaelic, Ancient British, Cambrian British, Greek,
Modern Greek, Latin, Proven&ccedil;al, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
French, Rommany.</p>
<p>I will, however, quote from &ldquo;The Sleeping Bard, or Visions
of the World, Death and Hell,&rdquo; his translation of Elis Wyn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Y Bardd Cwsg.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book would please Borrow, because
in the City of Perdition Rome stands at the gate of Pride, and the Pope
has palaces in the streets of Pleasure and of Lucre; because the Church
of England is the fairest part of the Catholic Church, surmounted by
&ldquo;Queen Anne on the pinnacle of the building, with a sword in each
hand&rdquo;; and because the Papist is turned away from the Catholic
Church by a porter with &ldquo;an exceedingly large Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;One fair morning,&rdquo; he begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One fair morning of genial April, when the earth was green
and pregnant, and Britain, like a paradise, was wearing splendid liveries,
tokens of the smile of the summer sun, I was walking upon the bank of
the Severn, in the midst of the sweet notes of the little songsters
of the wood, who appeared to be striving to break through all the measures
of music, whilst pouring forth praise to the Creator.&nbsp; I, too,
occasionally raised my voice and warbled with the feathered <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>choir,
though in a manner somewhat more restrained than that in which they
sang; and occasionally read a portion of the book of &lsquo;The Practice
of Godliness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in his vision he saw fiends drive men and women through the foul
river of the Fiend to their eternal damnation, where</p>
<p>&ldquo;I at the first glance saw more pains and torments than the
heart of man can imagine or the tongue relate; a single one of which
was sufficient to make the hair stand erect, the blood to freeze, the
flesh to melt, the bones to drop from their places&mdash;yea, the spirit
to faint.&nbsp; What is empaling or sawing men alive, tearing off the
flesh piecemeal with iron pincers, or broiling the flesh with candles,
collop fashion, or squeezing heads flat in a vice, and all the most
shocking devices which ever were upon earth, compared with one of these?&nbsp;
Mere pastime!&nbsp; There were a hundred thousand shoutings, hoarse
cries, and strong groans; yonder a boisterous wailing and horrible outcry
answering them, and the howling of a dog is sweet, delicious music when
compared with these sounds.&nbsp; When we had proceeded a little way
onward from the accursed beach, towards the wild place of Damnation,
I perceived, by their own light, innumerable men and women here and
there; and devils without number and without rest, incessantly employing
their strength in tormenting.&nbsp; Yes, there they were, devils and
damned, the devils roaring with their own torments, and making the damned
roar by means of the torments which they inflicted upon them.&nbsp;
I paid particular observation to the corner which was nearest me.&nbsp;
There I beheld the devils with pitchforks, tossing the damned up into
the air that they might fall headlong on poisoned hatchets or barbed
pikes, there to wriggle their bowels out.&nbsp; After a time the wretches
would crawl in multitudes, one upon another, to the top of one of the
burning crags, there to be broiled like mutton; from there they would
be <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>snatched
afar, to the top of one of the mountains of eternal frost and snow,
where they would be allowed to shiver for a time; thence they would
be precipitated into a loathsome pool of boiling brimstone, to wallow
there in conflagration, smoke and the suffocation of horrible stench;
from the pool they would be driven to the marsh of Hell, that they might
embrace and be embraced by the reptiles, many times worse than serpents
and vipers; after allowing them half an hour&rsquo;s dalliance with
these creatures the devils would seize a bundle of rods of steel, fiery
hot from the furnace, and would scourge them till their howling, caused
by the horrible inexpressible pain which they endured, would fill the
vast abode of darkness, and when the fiends deemed that they had scourged
them enough, they would take hot irons and sear their bloody wounds.
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this would have particularly pleased Borrow, who disliked and
condemned smoking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one of late origin I will not deny, O Cerberus, that thou
hast brought to us many a booty from the island of our enemies, by means
of tobacco, a weed the cause of much deceit; for how much deceit is
practised in carrying it about, in mixing it, and in weighing it: a
weed which entices some people to bib ale; others to curse, swear, and
to flatter in order to obtain it, and others to tell lies in denying
that they use it: a weed productive of maladies in various bodies, the
excess of which is injurious to every man&rsquo;s body, without speaking
of his <i>soul</i>: a weed, moreover, by which we get multitudes of
the poor, whom we should never get did they not set their love on tobacco,
allow it to master them, and pull the bread from the mouths of their
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the preface to this book as it was finally published in 1860,
Borrow said that the little Welsh bookseller had rejected it for fear
of being ruined&mdash;&ldquo;The terrible descriptions of vice and torment
would frighten the <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>genteel
part of the English public out of their wits. . . . I had no idea, till
I read him in English, that Elis Wyn had been such a terrible fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September, 1830, Borrow left London and returned to Norwich, having
done nothing which attracted attention or deserved to.&nbsp; His brother&rsquo;s
opinion was that his want of success in life was due chiefly to his
being unlike other people.&nbsp; So far as his failure in literature
went, it was due to the fact that he was doing either poorly or only
moderately well work that very few people wanted to read, viz., chiefly
verse translations from unfashionable languages.&nbsp; It may be also
that his health was partly the cause and was in turn lowered by the
long continued failure.&nbsp; When Borrow, at the age of forty or more,
came to write about the first twenty-two years of his life, he not only
described himself suffering from several attacks of &ldquo;the horrors,&rdquo;
but also with almost equal vividness three men suffering from mental
afflictions of different kinds: the author who lived alone and was continually
touching things to avert the evil chance; the old man who had saved
himself from being overwhelmed in his terrible misfortunes by studying
the inscriptions on Chinese pots, but could not tell the time; and the
Welshman who wandered over the country preaching and living piously,
but haunted by the knowledge that in his boyhood he had committed the
sin against the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; The most vivid description of his
&ldquo;horrors,&rdquo; which he said in 1834 always followed if they
did not result from weakness, is in the eighty-fourth chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaviness had suddenly come over me, heaviness of heart, and
of body also.&nbsp; I had accomplished the task which I had imposed
upon myself, and now that nothing more remained to do, my energies suddenly
deserted me, and I felt without strength, and without hope.&nbsp; Several
causes, perhaps, co-operated to bring about the state in which I <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>then
felt myself.&nbsp; It is not improbable that my energies had been overstrained
during the work, the progress of which I have attempted to describe;
and every one is aware that the results of overstrained energies are
feebleness and lassitude&mdash;want of nourishment might likewise have
something to do with it.&nbsp; During my sojourn in the dingle my food
had been of the simplest and most unsatisfying description, by no means
calculated to support the exertions which the labour I had been engaged
upon required; it had consisted of coarse oaten cakes, and hard cheese,
and for beverage I had been indebted to a neighbouring pit, in which,
in the heat of the day, I frequently saw, not golden or silver fish,
but frogs and efts swimming about.&nbsp; I am, however, inclined to
believe that Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s cake had quite as much to do with the
matter as insufficient nourishment.&nbsp; I had never entirely recovered
from the effects of its poison, but had occasionally, especially at
night, been visited by a grinding pain in the stomach, and my whole
body had been suffused with cold sweat; and indeed these memorials of
the drow have never entirely disappeared&mdash;even at the present time
they display themselves in my system, especially after much fatigue
of body, and excitement of mind.&nbsp; So there I sat in the dingle
upon my stone, nerveless and hopeless, by whatever cause or causes that
state had been produced&mdash;there I sat with my head leaning upon
my hand, and so I continued a long, long time.&nbsp; At last I lifted
my head from my hand, and began to cast anxious, unquiet looks about
the dingle&mdash;the entire hollow was now enveloped in deep shade&mdash;I
cast my eyes up; there was a golden gleam on the tops of the trees which
grew towards the upper parts of the dingle; but lower down, all was
gloom and twilight&mdash;yet, when I first sat down on my stone, the
sun was right above the dingle, illuminating all its depths by the rays
which it cast perpendicularly down&mdash;so I must have sat a long,
long <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>time
upon my stone.&nbsp; And now, once more, I rested my head upon my hand,
but almost instantly lifted it again in a kind of fear, and began looking
at the objects before me, the forge, the tools, the branches of the
trees, endeavouring to follow their rows, till they were lost in the
darkness of the dingle; and now I found my right hand grasping convulsively
the three forefingers of the left, first collectively, and then successively,
wringing them till the joints cracked; then I became quiet, but not
for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly I started up, and could scarcely repress the shriek
which was rising to my lips.&nbsp; Was it possible?&nbsp; Yes, all too
certain; the evil one was upon me; the inscrutable horror which I had
felt in my boyhood had once more taken possession of me.&nbsp; I had
thought that it had forsaken me; that it would never visit me again;
that I had outgrown it; that I might almost bid defiance to it; and
I had even begun to think of it without horror, as we are in the habit
of doing of horrors of which we conceive we run no danger; and lo! when
least thought of, it had seized me again.&nbsp; Every moment I felt
it gathering force, and making me more wholly its own.&nbsp; What should
I do?&mdash;resist, of course; and I did resist.&nbsp; I grasped, I
tore, and strove to fling it from me; but of what avail were my efforts?&nbsp;
I could only have got rid of it by getting rid of myself; it was a part
of myself, or rather it was all myself.&nbsp; I rushed among the trees,
and struck at them with my bare fists, and dashed my head against them,
but I felt no pain.&nbsp; How could I feel pain with that horror upon
me! and then I flung myself on the ground, gnawed the earth, and swallowed
it; and then I looked round; it was almost total darkness in the dingle,
and the darkness added to my horror.&nbsp; I could no longer stay there;
up I rose from the ground, and attempted to escape; at the bottom of
the winding path which led up the acclivity I fell over something which
was lying on the ground; the <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>something
moved, and gave a kind of whine.&nbsp; It was my little horse, which
had made that place its lair; my little horse; my only companion and
friend, in that now awful solitude.&nbsp; I reached the mouth of the
dingle; the sun was just sinking in the far west, behind me; the fields
were flooded with his last gleams.&nbsp; How beautiful everything looked
in the last gleams of the sun!&nbsp; I felt relieved for a moment; I
was no longer in the horrid dingle; in another minute the sun was gone,
and a big cloud occupied the place where he had been; in a little time
it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open part of
the dingle.&nbsp; My horror increased; what was I to do?&mdash;it was
of no use fighting against the horror; that I saw; the more I fought
against it, the stronger it became.&nbsp; What should I do: say my prayers?&nbsp;
Ah! why not?&nbsp; So I knelt down under the hedge, and said, &lsquo;Our
father&rsquo;; but that was of no use; and now I could no longer repress
cries; the horror was too great to be borne.&nbsp; What should I do:
run to the nearest town or village, and request the assistance of my
fellow-men?&nbsp; No! that I was ashamed to do; notwithstanding the
horror was upon me, I was ashamed to do that.&nbsp; I knew they would
consider me a maniac, if I went screaming amongst them; and I did not
wish to be considered a maniac.&nbsp; Moreover, I knew that I was not
a maniac, for I possessed all my reasoning powers, only the horror was
upon me&mdash;the screaming horror!&nbsp; But how were indifferent people
to distinguish between madness and this screaming horror?&nbsp; So I
thought and reasoned; and at last I determined not to go amongst my
fellow men, whatever the result might be.&nbsp; I went to the mouth
of the dingle, and there, placing myself on my knees, I again said the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; but it was of no use; praying seemed to have no
effect over the horror; the unutterable fear appeared rather to increase
than diminish; and I again uttered wild cries, so loud that <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>I
was apprehensive they would be heard by some chance passenger on the
neighbouring road; I therefore went deeper into the dingle; I sat down
with my back against a thorn bush; the thorns entered my flesh, and
when I felt them, I pressed harder against the bush; I thought the pain
of the flesh might in some degree counteract the mental agony; presently
I felt them no longer; the power of the mental horror was so great that
it was impossible, with that upon me, to feel any pain from the thorns.&nbsp;
I continued in this posture a long time, undergoing what I cannot describe,
and would not attempt if I were able.&nbsp; Several times I was on the
point of starting up and rushing anywhere; but I restrained myself,
for I knew I could not escape from myself, so why should I not remain
in the dingle?&nbsp; So I thought and said to myself, for my reasoning
powers were still uninjured.&nbsp; At last it appeared to me that the
horror was not so strong, not quite so strong upon me.&nbsp; Was it
possible that it was relaxing its grasp, releasing its prey?&nbsp; O
what a mercy! but it could not be&mdash;and yet I looked up to heaven,
and clasped my hands, and said &lsquo;Our Father.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said
no more; I was too agitated; and now I was almost sure that the horror
had done its worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a little time I arose, and staggered down yet farther
into the dingle.&nbsp; I again found my little horse on the same spot
as before, I put my hand to his mouth; he licked my hand.&nbsp; I flung
myself down by him and put my arms round his neck, the creature whinnied,
and appeared to sympathise with me; what a comfort to have any one,
even a dumb brute, to sympathise with me at such a moment!&nbsp; I clung
to my little horse, as if for safety and protection.&nbsp; I laid my
head on his neck, and felt almost calm; presently the fear returned,
but not so wild as before; it subsided, came again, again subsided;
then drowsiness came over me, and at last I fell asleep, my head <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>supported
on the neck of the little horse.&nbsp; I awoke; it was dark, dark night&mdash;not
a star was to be seen&mdash;but I felt no fear, the horror had left
me.&nbsp; I arose from the side of the little horse, and went into my
tent, lay down, and again went to sleep. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be said that the man who had gone through this, and could
describe it, would find it easy enough to depict other sufferings of
the same kind, though in later or less violent stages.&nbsp; It is certain,
however, that for such a one to acquire the habit of touching was easy.&nbsp;
He says himself, that after the night with the author who had this habit
and who feared ideas more than thunder and lightning, he himself touched
things and wondered if &ldquo;the long-forgotten influence&rdquo; had
returned.&nbsp; Mr. Walling says that &ldquo;he has been informed&rdquo;
that Borrow &ldquo;suffered in his youth from the touching mania,&rdquo;
and like many other readers probably, I had concluded the same.&nbsp;
But Mr. Watts-Dunton had already told us that &ldquo;in walking through
Richmond Park,&rdquo; when an old man, Borrow &ldquo;would step out
of his way constantly to touch a tree and was offended if observed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The old man diverting himself with Chinese inscriptions on teapots would
be an easy invention for Borrow; he may not have done this very thing,
but he had done similar things.&nbsp; Here again, Mr. Walling says that
&ldquo;he has been told&rdquo; the incident was drawn from Borrow&rsquo;s
own experience.&nbsp; As to Peter Williams and the sin against the Holy
Ghost, Borrow hinted to him that his case was not exceptional:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dost thou then imagine,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;the
sin against the Holy Ghost to be so common an occurrence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you have described it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;of
very common occurrence, especially amongst children, who are, indeed,
the only beings likely to commit it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; said Winifred, &lsquo;the young man talks
wisely.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>&ldquo;Peter
was silent for some moments, and appeared to be reflecting; at last,
suddenly raising his head, he looked me full in the face, and, grasping
my hand with vehemence, he said, &lsquo;Tell me, young man, only one
thing, hast thou, too, committed the sin against the Holy Ghost?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am neither Papist nor Methodist,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but
of the Church, and, being so, confess myself to no one, but keep my
own counsel; I will tell thee, however, had I committed at the same
age, twenty such sins as that which you committed, I should feel no
uneasiness at these years&mdash;but I am sleepy, and must go to rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is due to probably something more than a desire to make himself
and his past impressive.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s story in several places
reminds me of Borrow, where, for instance, after he has realised his
unpardonable sin, he runs wild through Wales, &ldquo;climbing mountains
and wading streams, burnt by the sun, drenched by the rain,&rdquo; so
that for three years he hardly knew what befel him, living with robbers
and Gypsies, and once about to fling himself into the sea from a lofty
rock.</p>
<p>If it be true, as it is likely, that Borrow suffered in a more extended
manner than he showed in his accounts of the horrors, the time of the
suffering is still uncertain.&nbsp; Was it before his first escape from
London, as he says in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;?&nbsp; Was it during his
second long stay in London or after his second escape?&nbsp; Or was
it really not long before the actual narrative was written in the &rsquo;forties?&nbsp;
There is some reason for thinking so.&nbsp; The most vivid description
of &ldquo;the horrors,&rdquo; and the account of the touching gentleman
and of Peter Williams, together with a second reference to &ldquo;the
horrors&rdquo; or the &ldquo;evil one,&rdquo; all occur in a section
of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; equal to hardly more than a sixth of the whole.&nbsp;
And further, when Borrow was writing &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; or when
he met the sickly young man at <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the
&ldquo;Castle Inn&rdquo; of Caernarvon, he thought of himself as always
having had &ldquo;the health of an elephant.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should be
inclined to conclude at least that when he was forty great mental suffering
was still fresh in his mind, something worse than the heavy melancholy
which returned now and then when he was past fifty.</p>
<h2><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>CHAPTER
XVII&mdash;THE BIBLE SOCIETY: RUSSIA</h2>
<p>From the phrase, &ldquo;He said in &rsquo;32,&rdquo; which Borrow
uses of himself in Chapter X. of the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
it was to be concluded that he was writing political articles in 1832;
and Dr. Knapp was able to quote a manuscript of the time where he says
that &ldquo;there is no Radical who would not rejoice to see his native
land invaded by the bitterest of her foreign enemies,&rdquo; etc., and
also a letter, printed in the &ldquo;Norfolk Chronicle,&rdquo; on August
18, 1832, on the origin of the word &ldquo;Tory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of this year he became friendly with the family of Skepper,
including the widowed Mrs. Mary Clarke, then 36 years old, who lived
at Oulton Hall, near Lowestoft, in Suffolk.&nbsp; With or through them
he met the Rev. Francis Cunningham, Vicar of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Lowestoft,
who had married a sister of the Quaker banker, Joseph John Gurney, and
through the offices of these two, Borrow was invited to go before the
British and Foreign Bible Society, as a candidate for employment in
some branch of the Society&rsquo;s work where his knowledge of languages
would be useful.&nbsp; He walked to London for the purpose in December,
1832.&nbsp; The Society was satisfied and sent him back to Norwich to
learn the Manchu-Tartar language.&nbsp; There he wrote a letter, which,
if we take Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s word for it, was &ldquo;a sort of recantation
of the Taylorism of 1824.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being now near thirty, and perhaps
having his worst &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; behind him, or at least having
reason to think so if he was already fond of Mrs. Clarke, whom he afterwards
married, it was easy for him to fall into the <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>same
way of speaking as these good and kindly people, and to abuse Buddhism,
which he did not understand, for their delectation.&nbsp; Mrs. Clarke
had four or five hundred pounds a year of her own, and one child, a
daughter, then about fourteen years old.&nbsp; Perhaps it was natural
that he should remember then, as he did later, the words of the cheerful
and forgetful wise man: &ldquo;I have been young and now am grown old,
yet never have I seen the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a gloomily fanatical atheist Borrow changed to a cheerfully
fanatical Protestant, described as &ldquo;of the middle order in society,
and a very produceable person.&rdquo; <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126">{126}</a>&nbsp;
He was probably never a good atheist of the reasonable critical type
like William Taylor, whose thinking was too dull and too difficult for
him.&nbsp; Above all it was too negative and unrelated to anything but
the brain for the man who wrote &ldquo;Lines to Six-foot-three&rdquo;
and consorted with Gypsies.&nbsp; He had taken atheism along with Taylor&rsquo;s
literary and linguistic teaching, perhaps with some eagerness at first
as a form of protest against conventionally pious and respectable Norwich
life.&nbsp; The Bible Society and Mrs. Clarke and her friends came radiant
and benevolent to his &ldquo;looped and windowed&rdquo; atheism.&nbsp;
They gave him friends and money: they gave him an occupation on which
he felt, and afterwards found, that he could spend his hesitating energies.&nbsp;
He gathered up all his powers to serve the Bible Society.&nbsp; He suffered
hunger, cold, imprisonment, wounded feet, long hours of indoor labour
and long hours of dismal attendance upon inexorable official delay.&nbsp;
Personally he irritated Mr. Brandram, the secretary, and his bold and
unexpected ways gave the Society something to put up with, but he was
always a faithful and enthusiastic servant.&nbsp; He had many reasons
for being <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>grateful
to them.&nbsp; He, who was going to get himself imprisoned for atheism,
had already become, as Mr. Cunningham thought, a man &ldquo;of certain
Christian principle,&rdquo; if &ldquo;of no very exactly defined denomination
of Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; He certainly did become an unquestioning
wild missionary&mdash;though not merely wild, for he was discreet in
his boldness; he was careful to save the Society money; he made himself
respected by the highest English and Spanish officials in Spain; so
that in 1837, for the first time in the Society&rsquo;s history, an
English ambassador made their cause a national one.&nbsp; He wanted
to shout and the Bible Society gave him something to shout for.&nbsp;
He wanted to fight and they gave him something to fight for.&nbsp; Twenty
years afterwards, in writing the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
he looked back on his travels in Spain as on a campaign:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true he went to Spain with the colours of that Society
on his hat&mdash;oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the marrow awakes
in his old bones when he thinks of what he accomplished in Spain in
the cause of religion and civilisation with the colours of that Society
on his hat, and its weapon in his hand, even the sword of the word of
God; how with that weapon he hewed left and right, making the priests
fly before him, and run away squeaking: &lsquo;Vaya! que demonio es
este!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ay, and when he thinks of the plenty of bible swords
which he left behind him, destined to prove, and which have already
proved, pretty calthrops in the heels of Popery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hallo!
Batuschca,&rsquo; he exclaimed the other night, on reading an article
in a newspaper; &lsquo;what do you think of the present doings in Spain?&nbsp;
Your old friend the zingaro, the gitano who rode about Spain, to say
nothing of Galicia, with the Greek Buchini behind him as his squire,
had a hand in bringing them about; there are many brave Spaniards connected
with <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the
present movement who took Bibles from his hands, and read them and profited
by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was as sure in 1839 as in 1857 of the diabolic power and intention
of Popery, that &ldquo;unrelenting fiend,&rdquo; whose secrets few,
he said, knew more than himself. <a name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a">{128a}</a></p>
<p>In the gladness of his now fully exerted powers of body and mind,
travelling in wild country and observing and conflicting with men, he
adopted not merely the unctuous phraseology of &ldquo;I am at present,
thanks be to the Lord, comfortable and happy,&rdquo; <a name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b">{128b}</a>
but a more attractive religious arrogance.&nbsp; &ldquo;That I am an
associate of Gypsies and fortune-tellers I do not deny,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;and why should I be ashamed of their company when my Master mingled
with publicans and thieves.&rdquo; <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c">{128c}</a>&nbsp;
He painted himself as a possible martyr among the wild Catholics, a
St. Stephen.&nbsp; When he suffered at the same time from hardship and
the Society&rsquo;s disfavour, he exclaimed: &ldquo;It was God&rsquo;s
will that I, who have risked all and lost almost all in the cause, be
taunted, suspected, and the sweat of agony and tears which I have poured
out be estimated at the value of the water of the ditch or the moisture
which exudes from rotten dung.&nbsp; But I murmur not, and hope I shall
at all times be willing to bow to the dispensations of the Almighty.&rdquo;
<a name="citation128d"></a><a href="#footnote128d">{128d}</a>&nbsp;
He exulted in melodramatic nature, in the sublime of Salvator Rosa,
in the desperate, wild, and strange.&nbsp; His very prayers, as reported
by himself to the Secretary, distressed the Society because they were
&ldquo;passionate.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, he could sometimes, under the
inspiration of the respectable Secretary, write like a perfect middle-class
English Christian.&nbsp; He condemned the Sunday amusements of Hamburg,
for example, remarking that &ldquo;England, with all her faults, has
still some regard to decency, and <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>will
not tolerate such a shameful display of vice&rdquo; (as rope-dancing)
&ldquo;in so sacred a season, when a decent cheerfulness is the freest
form in which the mind or countenance ought to invest themselves.&rdquo;
<a name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a">{129a}</a>&nbsp;
He argued against the translator of the Bible into Manchu that concessions
should not be made to a Chinese way of thought, because it was the object
of the Society to wean the Chinese from their own customs and observances,
not to encourage them.&nbsp; But the opposite extreme was more congenial
to Borrow.&nbsp; He would go to the market place in a remote Spanish
village and display his Testaments on the outspread horsecloth, crying:
&ldquo;Peasants, peasants, I bring you the Word of God at a cheap price.&rdquo;
<a name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b">{129b}</a>&nbsp;
He would disguise himself, travelling with a sack of Testaments on his
donkey; and when a woman asked if it was soap he had, he answered: &ldquo;Yes;
it is soap to wash souls clean.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the man to understand
Peter Williams, the Welsh preacher who had committed the sin against
the Holy Ghost and wandered about preaching and refusing a roof.&nbsp;
Neither must it be forgotten that this was the man who, in a conversation
not reported to the Bible Society, said: &ldquo;What befalls my body
or soul was written in a <i>gabicote</i> a thousand years before the
foundation of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was only seven weeks in getting so far as to be able to translate
from Manchu, though it had been said, as he pointed out, that the language
took five or six years to acquire.&nbsp; It cost him an even shorter
time to acquire the dialect of his employers, for in less than a month
after he had retired to Norwich to learn Manchu, he was writing thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revd. and Dear Sir,&mdash;I have just received your communication,
and notwithstanding it is Sunday morning, <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>and
the bells with their loud and clear voices are calling me to church,
I have sat down to answer it by return of post. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return my kind and respected friend, Mr. Brandram, my best
thanks for his present of &lsquo;The Gypsies&rsquo; Advocate,&rsquo;
and assure him that, next to the acquirement of Mandchou, the conversion
and enlightening of those interesting people occupy the principal place
in my mind. . . . <a name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130">{130}</a></p>
<p>Never had his linguistic power a greater or more profitable triumph
than in this acquisition.&nbsp; As this was probably a dialect not unknown
at Earlham, Norwich, and Oulton, among people whom he loved, respected,
or beheld successful, the difficulty of the task was a little decreased.&nbsp;
Thurtell and Haggart had passed away, Petulengro had not yet reappeared.&nbsp;
There was no one to tell him that he was living in a country and an
age that were afterwards to appear among the most ignorant and cruel
on record.&nbsp; He himself had not yet discovered the &ldquo;gentility-nonsense,&rdquo;
nor did he ever discover that gentility was of the same family, if it
was not an albinism of the same species, as pious and oily respectability.&nbsp;
So delighted was he with the new dialect that he rolled it on his tongue
to the confusion of habitu&eacute;s, who had to rap him over the knuckles
for speaking of becoming &ldquo;useful to the Deity, to man, and to
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July, 1833, Borrow was appointed, with a salary of &pound;200
a year and expenses, to go to St. Petersburg, to help in editing a Manchu
translation of the New Testament, or transcribing and collating a translation
of the Old, accompanied by a warning against &ldquo;a tone of confidence
in speaking of yourself&rdquo; in such a phrase as &ldquo;useful to
the Deity, to man, and to yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow accepted the
correction, and Norwich laughed at him in his new suit.&nbsp; <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>At
the end of July he sailed, and as at this time he had no objection to
gentility he regretted the end of his passage with so many &ldquo;genteel,
well-bred and intelligent passengers,&rdquo; though he had suffered
from sea-sickness, followed by &ldquo;the horrors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Petersburg he thought the finest of the many capitals he had
seen.&nbsp; He made the acquaintance of several men who could help him
with their learning and their books, and above all he gained the friendship
of John P. Hasfeldt, a Dane, a little older than himself, who was interpreter
to the Danish Legation and teacher of European languages, evidently
a man after Borrow&rsquo;s own heart, with his opinion that &ldquo;The
greater part of those products of art, called &lsquo;the learned,&rsquo;
would not be able to earn a living if our Lord were not a guardian of
fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; The copying of the Old Testament was finished by
the end of the year, without having prevented Borrow from profiting
by his unusual facilities for the acquisition of languages.&nbsp; He
had then to superintend, or as it fell out, to help largely with his
own hands, the printing of the first Manchu translation of the New Testament,
with type which had first to be cleansed of ten years&rsquo; rust and
with compositors who knew nothing of Manchu.&nbsp; Lacking almost in
time to eat or to sleep he impressed the Bible Society by his prodigious
labours under &ldquo;the blessing of a kind and gracious Providence
watching over the execution of a work in which the wide extension of
the Saviour&rsquo;s glory is involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was living cheaply, suffering sometimes from &ldquo;the horrors,&rdquo;
and curing them with port wine&mdash;sending money home to his mother,
bidding her to employ a maid and to read and &ldquo;think as much of
God as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was he doing merely what he was bound
to do.&nbsp; For example, he translated some of the &ldquo;Homilies
of the Church of England&rdquo; into Russian and into Manchu.&nbsp;
He also published in St. Petersburg his &ldquo;Targum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Talisman,&rdquo;
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>a
short further collection of translations from Pushkin, Mickiewicz, and
from Russian national songs.&nbsp; The work was finished and formally
and kindly approved by the Bible Society.&nbsp; He had proposed long
before that he should distribute the books himself, wandering overland
with them by Lake Ba&iuml;kal and Kiakhta right to Pekin; but the Russian
Government refused a passport.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp believes that this intention
of going among the Tartars and overland from Russia to Pekin was the
sole ground for his crediting himself with travels in the Far East.&nbsp;
In the flesh he had to content himself with a journey to Novgorod and
Moscow.&nbsp; As he had visited the Jews at Hamburg so he did the Gypsies
at Moscow.&nbsp; This adventure moved him to his first characteristic
piece of prose, in a letter to the Society.&nbsp; This letter, which
was afterwards printed in the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo; <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132">{132}</a>
and incorporated in &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; mentions the Gypsies
who have become successful singers and married noblemen, but continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not, however, to be supposed that all the female Gypsies
are of this high, talented and respectable order: amongst them are many
low and profligate females, who sing at taverns or at the various gardens
in the neighbourhood, and whose husbands and male connexions subsist
by horse jobbing and like kinds of traffic.&nbsp; The principal place
of resort of this class is Marina Rotche, lying about two versts from
Moscow, and thither I drove, attended by a <i>valet de place</i>.&nbsp;
Upon my arriving there, the Gypsies swarmed out from their tents, and
from the little tradeer, or tavern, and surrounded me; standing on the
seat of the cal&egrave;che, I addressed them in a loud voice in the
dialect of the English Gypsies, with which I have some slight acquaintance.&nbsp;
A scream of wonder instantly arose, and welcomes and greetings were
poured forth in torrents of <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>musical
Rommany, amongst which, however, the most prominent air was, &lsquo;Ah
kak mi toute karmama,&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, how we love you&rsquo;; for
at first they supposed me to be one of their brothers, who they said,
were wandering about in Turkey, China, and other parts, and that I had
come over the great pawnee, or water, to visit them. . . . I visited
this place several times during my sojourn at Moscow, and spoke to them
upon their sinful manner of living, upon the advent and suffering of
Christ Jesus, and expressed, upon my taking leave of them, a hope that
they would be in a short period furnished with the word of eternal life
in their own language, which they seemed to value and esteem much higher
than the Russian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of this letter suggests that it was meant for the Bible
Society&mdash;and a copy was addressed to them&mdash;but at this date
it is possible to see in it an outline of the Gypsy gentleman, very
much the gentleman, the &ldquo;colossal clergyman&rdquo; of later days.</p>
<p>Borrow liked the Russians, and for some reasons was sorry to leave
them and Hasfeldt in September, 1835.&nbsp; But for other reasons he
was glad.&nbsp; He would see his mother and comfort her for the loss
of her elder son in November, 1833, as he had already done to some extent
by telling her that he would &ldquo;endeavour to get ordained.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He also would see Mrs. Clarke, with whom he had been corresponding for
the past two years.&nbsp; Both she and his mother had been unwilling
for him to go to Pekin.</p>

XVIII&mdash;THE BIBLE SOCIETY: SPAIN</h2>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s chief regret at leaving Russia was that his active
life was interrupted, perhaps at an end.&nbsp; He was dreading the old
life of unprofitable study with no complete friends.&nbsp; But luckily,
when he had only been a month in England, the Bible Society resolved
to send him to Lisbon and Oporto, to look for openings for circulating
the Bible in Portugal and perhaps in Spain.&nbsp; After this they had
thoughts of sending him to China by sea.&nbsp; In November, 1835, he
sailed for Lisbon.</p>
<p>Spain was at this time the victim of private quarrels which had been
allowed to assume public importance.&nbsp; King Ferdinand VII. had twice
been restored to an unloving people by foreign, especially English,
aid.&nbsp; This King had for heir his brother Carlos, until his fourth
wife, Maria Christina, bore him a daughter, Isabella, in 1830; and to
secure her succession he set aside the Salic law.&nbsp; In 1833 he died.&nbsp;
Isabella II. was proclaimed Queen, and Christina Regent.&nbsp; Christinists
and Carlists were soon at war, and very bloody war.&nbsp; The English
intervened, once diplomatically, once with a foreign legion.&nbsp; The
war wavered, with success now to the Carlist Generals Zumalacarregui
and Cabrera and now to the Christinist Espartero.&nbsp; There were new
Prime Ministers about twice yearly.&nbsp; The parties were divided amongst
themselves, and treachery was common.&nbsp; The only result that could
always be foreseen was that the people and the country would suffer.&nbsp;
Not until 1841 did Espartero finally defeat Cabrera.</p>
<p>Portugal, in 1835, had just had its eight years of civil <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>war
between the partisans of a child&mdash;Maria II.&mdash;aged seven, and
her uncle, Miguel, ending in the departure of Miguel.&nbsp; Borrow made
a preliminary journey in the forlorn country and decided for Spain instead.&nbsp;
Escaping the bullets of Portuguese soldiers, he crossed the boundary
at the beginning of 1836 and entered Badajoz.&nbsp; There he met the
Gypsies, and put off his journey to Madrid to see more of them and translate
the fifteenth chapter of St. Luke into their tongue.&nbsp; At Merida
he stopped again for a Gypsy wedding.&nbsp; His guide was the Gypsy,
Antonio Lopez, who sold him the donkey which he rode as far as Talavera.&nbsp;
At Madrid his business was to print the New Testament in a Spanish Catholic
translation.&nbsp; He had to wait; but with a new Cabinet permission
was obtained and arrangements for the printing were made.&nbsp; The
Revolution of La Granja, which he describes in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo;
caused another delay.&nbsp; Then, in October, after a visit to the Gypsies
of Granada, he returned to London.</p>
<p>He had written long letters to the Bible Society, and one which was
combined and published in the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo; with that
written from Moscow.&nbsp; It is dated, Madrid, July 19, 1836, but describes
his visit to Badajoz on January 6.&nbsp; He says, on entering Badajoz:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I instantly returned thanks to God, who had protected me during
a journey of five days through the wilds of the Alemtejo, the province
of Portugal the most infested by robbers and desperate characters, and
which I had traversed with no other human companion than a lad, nearly
idiotic, who was to convey back the mules which carried myself and luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men were passing him in the street, and seeing the face of one
he touched his arm: &ldquo;I said a certain word, to which, after an
exclamation of surprise, he responded in the manner I expected.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They were Gypsies.&nbsp; He continues:</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>&ldquo;They
left me in haste and went about the town informing the rest that a stranger
had arrived who spoke Rommany as well as themselves, who had the eyes
and face of a Gitano, and seemed to be of the &lsquo;cratti&rsquo; or
blood.&nbsp; In less than half an hour the street before the inn was
filled with the men, women and children of Egypt.&nbsp; I went out amongst
them, and my heart sank within me as I surveyed them; so much squalidness,
dirt and misery I had never before seen amongst a similar number of
human beings; but the worst of all was the evil expression of their
countenances, denoting that they were familiar with every species of
crime, and it was not long before I found that their countenances did
not belie them.&nbsp; After they had asked me an infinity of questions,
and felt my hands, face, and clothes, they returned to their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stayed with them nearly three weeks, he says; about ten days,
says Dr. Knapp.&nbsp; Borrow continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result of my observations was a firm belief that the Spanish
Gitanos are the most vile, degraded and wretched people upon the earth.&nbsp;
The great wickedness of these outcasts may, perhaps, be attributed to
their having abandoned their wandering life and become inmates of the
towns, where, to the original bad traits of their character, they have
superadded the evil and vicious habits of the rabble. . . . They listened
with admiration, but alas, not of the truths, the eternal truths I was
telling them, but at finding that their broken jargon could be written
and read; the only words of assent to the heavenly doctrine which I
ever obtained, and which were rather of the negative kind, were the
following, from a woman&mdash;&lsquo;Brother! you tell us strange things,
though perhaps you do not lie; a month since I would sooner have believed
these tales than that I should this day have seen one who could write
Rommany.&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>He
preserves the clergyman, but deepens the Gypsy stain.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo;
was &ldquo;not at liberty on this occasion&rdquo; to publish the name
of this man whom Gypsies called &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; but apparently
it would not be the name of any writer hitherto known to readers of
the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a month in England, and then left for Spain to print and distribute
Testaments.&nbsp; He had hardly put his feet on Spanish soil than, said
the Marquis of Santa Colona, <a name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137">{137}</a>
he &ldquo;looked round, saw some Gypsies lounging there, said something
that the Marquis could not understand, and immediately &lsquo;that man
became <i>une grappe de Gitanos</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; They hung round his
neck, clung to his knees, seized his hands, kissed his feet, so that
the Marquis hardly liked to join his comrade again, after such close
embraces by so dirty a company.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Cordova he was very
well received by the Gypsies &ldquo;on the supposition that he was one
of their own race.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says in &ldquo;The Gypsies of Spain&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for myself, I was admitted without scruple to their private
meetings, and was made a participator of their most secret thoughts.&nbsp;
During our intercourse, some remarkable scenes occurred: one night more
than twenty of us, men and women, were assembled in a long low room
on the ground floor, in a dark alley or court in the old gloomy town
of Cordova.&nbsp; After the Gitanos had discussed several jockey plans,
and settled some private bargains amongst themselves, we all gathered
round a huge brasero of flaming charcoal, and began conversing <i>sobre
las cosas de Egypto</i>, when I proposed that, as we had no better means
of amusing ourselves, we should endeavour to turn into the Calo language
some piece of devotion, that we might see whether this language, the
gradual decay of which I had frequently heard them lament, was capable
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>of
expressing any other matters than those which related to horses, mules,
and Gypsy traffic.&nbsp; It was in this cautious manner that I first
endeavoured to divert the attention of these singular people to matters
of eternal importance.&nbsp; My suggestion was received with acclamations,
and we forthwith proceeded to the translation of the Apostle&rsquo;s
Creed.&nbsp; I first recited in Spanish, in the usual manner and without
pausing, this noble confession, and then repeated it again, sentence
by sentence, the Gitanos translating as I proceeded.&nbsp; They exhibited
the greatest eagerness and interest in their unwonted occupation, and
frequently broke into loud disputes as to the best rendering&mdash;many
being offered at the same time.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, I wrote down
from their dictation, and at the conclusion I read aloud the translation,
the result of the united wisdom of the assembly, whereupon they all
raised a shout of exultation, and appeared not a little proud of the
composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his desire to see the Gypsies and the ways of the people he more
than doubled his difficulties, and suffered from cold and the rudeness
of the roads and of the people.&nbsp; But in spite of the internecine
civil war he got safe to Madrid.&nbsp; Printing was begun in 1837, and
when copies were ready Borrow advertised them and arranged for their
distribution.&nbsp; He himself set out with his servant, Antonio Buchini,
a Greek of Constantinople, who had served an infinity of masters, and
once been a cook to the overbearing General Cordova, and answered the
General&rsquo;s sword with a pistol.&nbsp; They travelled to Salamanca,
Valladolid, Leon, Astorga, Villafranca, Lugo, Coru&ntilde;a, to Santiago,
Vigo, and again to Coru&ntilde;a, to Ferrol, Oviedo, Santander, Burgos,
Valladolid, and so back to Madrid in October.&nbsp; He had suffered
from fever, dysentery and ophthalmia on the journey.&nbsp; According
to Dr. Knapp it was the most unpropitious country possible.&nbsp; If
chosen by anything but ignorance, it must have been by whim and the
unconscious <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>desire
to delight posterity and amaze Dr. Knapp.&nbsp; Borrow had met, among
others, Benedict Mol, the Swiss seeker after treasure hidden in the
earth under the Church of San Roque at St. James&rsquo; of Compostella.&nbsp;
This traveller was not his only acquaintance.&nbsp; He formed a friendship
at Madrid with the Spanish scholar, Luis de Usoz, afterwards editor
of &ldquo;The Early Spanish Reformers,&rdquo; who became a member of
the Bible Society, helped Borrow in editing the Spanish Testament, and
looked after his interests while he was away from Madrid.&nbsp; At St.
James&rsquo; itself he made a friend and a co-operator of the old bookseller,
Rey Romero, who knew Benedict Moll.</p>
<p>Borrow returned to the sale of Testaments at Madrid, and to his own
favourite project of printing his Spanish Gypsy translation of the Gospel
of St. Luke.&nbsp; To advertise his Testaments he posted up and sent
about flaming tricoloured placards.&nbsp; This was too much for the
Moderate Government which had followed the Liberals: the sale of Testaments
was stopped, and that for thirty years after.&nbsp; The officials had
been irritated by the far graver indiscretions of another but irregular
agent of the Bible Society, Lieutenant Graydon, R.N., &ldquo;a fervid
Irish Protestant.&rdquo; <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139">{139}</a>&nbsp;
Apparently this man had advertised Bibles in Valencia as to be sold
at very low prices and even given away; had printed abuse of the Spanish
clergy and Government, and had described himself as co-operating with
Borrow.&nbsp; Except at Madrid, the Bibles and Testaments in Borrow&rsquo;s
dep&ocirc;ts throughout Spain were seized by the Government.&nbsp; The
books had at last to be sent out of the country, British Consuls were
forbidden to countenance religious agents; and in the opinion of the
Consul at Seville, J. M. Brackenbury, this was directly due to Graydon&rsquo;s
indiscretions.&nbsp; The Society were kind to him.&nbsp; They cautioned
him not to attack Popery, but to leave the Bible to speak <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>for
itself.&nbsp; The caution was vain, but in spite of the harm done to
Borrow and themselves they recalled Graydon with but a qualified disavowal
of his conduct.&nbsp; Borrow did not conceal from the Society his opinion
that this man, with his &ldquo;lunatic vagaries,&rdquo; had been the
&ldquo;evil genius&rdquo; of the Bible cause and of himself.&nbsp; The
incident did no good to the already bickering relations between Borrow
and the Rev. A. Brandram, the Secretary.&nbsp; Evidently Borrow&rsquo;s
character jarred upon Brandram, who took revenge by a tone of facetious
cavil and several criticisms upon Borrow&rsquo;s ways, upon his confident
masculine tone, for example, his &ldquo;passionate&rdquo; prayer, and
his confession of superstitious obedience to an ominous dream.&nbsp;
Brandram even took the trouble to remind Borrow that when it came to
distribution in Russia his success had ended: which was true but not
through any fault of his.&nbsp; Borrow took the criticism as if applied
to his Spanish work also, saying: &ldquo;It was unkind and unjust to
taunt me with having been unsuccessful in distributing the Scriptures.&nbsp;
Allow me to state that no other person under the same circumstances
would have distributed the tenth part.&nbsp; Yet had I been utterly
unsuccessful, it would have been wrong to charge me with being so, after
all I have undergone&mdash;and with how little of that are you acquainted.&rdquo;
<a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140">{140}</a>&nbsp; If
Borrow had been as revengeful as Dr. Knapp believed him, he would not
have allowed Brandram to escape an immortality of hate in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow irritated the Spanish Government yet a little more by issuing
his Gypsy &ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; and in May, 1838, he was illegally imprisoned
in the <i>Carcel de Corte</i>, where he insisted upon staying until
he was set free with honour and the payment of his expenses.&nbsp; He
vindicated his position by a letter to a newspaper, pointing out that
his Society was neither sectarian nor political, and that he was their
<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>sole
authorised agent.&nbsp; This led directly to the breaking of his connection
with the Bible Society, who reprimanded him for his letter and virtually
recalled him from Spain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Borrow made a series of excursions into the country
to sell his Testaments, until in August he was definitely recalled.&nbsp;
He returned to England, as he says himself, for &ldquo;change of scene
and air&rdquo; after an attack of fever.&nbsp; He obtained a new lease
from the Bible Society and was back in Spain at the end of 1838.&nbsp;
Early in 1839 he made further excursions with Antonio Lopez to sell
his Testaments, until he had to stop.&nbsp; Thereupon he went to Seville.&nbsp;
He was still forming plans on behalf of the Society.&nbsp; He wished
to go to La Mancha, the worst part of Spain, then through Saragossa
and into France.</p>
<p>At Seville it was, in May, 1839, that Colonel Napier met him.&nbsp;
Nobody knew who, or of what nationality, he was&mdash;this &ldquo;mysterious
Unknown,&rdquo; the white-haired young man, with dark eyes of almost
supernatural penetration and lustre, who gave himself out to be thirty
instead of thirty-five, who spoke English, French, Italian, Spanish,
German, and Romaic to those who best understood these languages.&nbsp;
Borrow and Napier rode out together to the ruins of Italica:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sat down,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;on a fragment of the walls;
the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; began to feel the vein of poetry creeping
through his inward soul, and gave vent to it by reciting, with great
emphasis and effect, the following well-known and beautiful lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower, grown<br />
Matted and massed together, hillocks heap&rsquo;d<br />
On what were chambers, arch crush&rsquo;d, column strown<br />
In fragments, choked up vaults, and frescoes steep&rsquo;d<br />
In subterranean damps, where the owl peep&rsquo;d,<br />
Deeming it midnight:&mdash;Temples, baths, or halls&mdash;<br />
Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reap&rsquo;d<br />
From her research hath been, that these are walls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had been too much taken up with the scene, the <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>verses,
and the strange being who was repeating them with so much feeling, to
notice the approach of a slight female figure, beautiful in the extreme,
but whose tattered garments, raven hair, swarthy complexion, and flashing
eyes, proclaimed her to be of the wandering tribe of Gitanos.&nbsp;
From an intuitive sense of politeness she stood with crossed arms and
a slight smile on her dark and handsome countenance, until my companion
had ceased, and then addressed us in the usual whining tone of supplication&mdash;&lsquo;Gentlemen,
a little charity; God will repay it to you!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Gypsy girl
was so pretty and her voice so sweet, that I involuntarily put my hand
in my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said the &lsquo;Unknown.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you remember what I told you of the Eastern origin of these
people?&nbsp; You shall see I am correct.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come here,
my pretty child,&rsquo; said he in Moultanee, &lsquo;and tell me where
are the rest of your tribe.&rsquo;&nbsp; The girl looked astounded,
and replied in the same tongue, but in broken language; when, taking
him by the arm, she said in Spanish: &lsquo;Come, Caballero, come to
one who will be able to answer you&rsquo;; and she led the way down
among the ruins towards one of the dens formerly occupied by the wild
beasts, and disclosed to us a set of beings scarcely less savage.&nbsp;
The sombre walls of this gloomy abode were illumined by a fire, the
smoke from which escaped through a deep fissure in the mossy roof, whilst
the flickering flames threw a blood-red glare on the bronzed features
of a group of children, two men, and a decrepit old hag who appeared
busily engaged in some culinary operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our entrance, the scowling glance of the males of the party,
and a quick motion of the hand towards the folds of the faja (where
the clasp-knife is concealed), caused in me, at least, anything but
a comfortable sensation; but their hostile intentions were immediately
removed by a wave of the hand from our conductress, who, leading my
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>companion
towards the sibyl, whispered something in her ear.&nbsp; The old crone
appeared incredulous.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; uttered one word;
but that word had the effect of magic.&nbsp; She prostrated herself
at his feet, and in an instant, from an object of suspicion, he became
one of worship to the whole family, to whom on taking leave he made
a handsome present, and departed with their united blessings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, as the phrase goes, dying with curiosity, and as soon
as we mounted our horses, exclaimed: &lsquo;Where, in the name of goodness,
did you pick up your acquaintance with the language of these extraordinary
people?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Some years ago, in Moultan,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And by what means do you possess such apparent influence over
them?&rsquo;&nbsp; But the &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; had already said more
than he perhaps wished on the subject.&nbsp; He dryly replied that he
had more than once owed his life to Gypsies and had reason to know them
well; but this was said in a tone which precluded all further queries
on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This report is a wonderful testimony to Borrow&rsquo;s power, for
he seems to have made the Colonel write almost like himself and produce
a picture exactly like those which he so often draws of himself.</p>
<p>From Seville Borrow took a journey of a few weeks to Tangier and
Barbary.&nbsp; There he met the strongest man in Tangier, one of the
old Moors of Granada, who waved a barrel of water over his head as if
it had been a quart pot.&nbsp; There he and his Jewish servant, Hayim
Ben Attar, sold Testaments, and, says he, &ldquo;with humble gratitude
to the Lord,&rdquo; the blessed Book was soon in the hands of most of
the Christians in Tangier.&nbsp; But with an account of his first day
in the city he concluded &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was back again in Seville he had the society of Mrs. Clarke
and her daughter; Henrietta, who had come to Spain to avoid some legal
difficulties and presumably <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>to
see Borrow.&nbsp; Before the end of 1839 the engagement of Borrow and
Mrs. Clarke was announced without surprising old Mrs. Borrow at Norwich.&nbsp;
In November Borrow wrote almost his last long letter to the Bible Society.&nbsp;
He had the advantage of a singular address, being for the moment in
the prison of Seville, where he had been illegally thrown, after a quarrel
with the Alcalde over the matter of a passport.&nbsp; He told them how
this &ldquo;ruffian&rdquo; quailed before his gaze of defiance.&nbsp;
He told them how well he was treated by his fellow prisoners:</p>

So well did Borrow choose his company, even in prison.&nbsp; Some of
his letters to the Society went astray at this time and he was vainly
expected in England.&nbsp; He was able to send them a very high testimony
to his discretion from the English Consul at Seville, and he himself
reminded them that he had been &ldquo;fighting with wild beasts&rdquo;
during this last visit.&nbsp; The Society several times repeated his
recall, but he did not return, apparently because he wished to remain
with Mrs. Clarke in Seville, and because he no longer felt himself at
their beck and call.&nbsp; He was also at work on &ldquo;The Gypsies
of Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless he wrote to the Society in March,
<!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>1840,
a letter which would have been remarkable from another man about to
marry a wife, for he said that he wished to spend the remaining years
of his life in the northern parts of China, as he thought he had a call,
and still hoped &ldquo;to die in the cause of my Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In April he left Spain with Mrs. and Miss Clarke.&nbsp; Fifty or sixty
years later Mrs. Joseph Pennell &ldquo;saw the sign, &lsquo;G. Borrow,
Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society,&rsquo; high upon a house
in the Plaza de la Constitucion, in Seville.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was
never again in Spain.&nbsp; After reporting himself for the last time
to the Society, and making a suggestion which Brandram answered by saying,
&ldquo;the door seems shut,&rdquo; he married Mrs. Clarke on April 23,
1840.&nbsp; She had &pound;450 a year and a home at Oulton.&nbsp; Fifteen
or sixteen years later he spoke of his wife and daughter thus: &ldquo;Of
my wife I will merely say that she is a perfect paragon of wives&mdash;can
make puddings and sweets and treacle posset, and is the best woman of
business in Eastern Anglia&mdash;of my step daughter&mdash;for such
she is, though I generally call her daughter, and with good reason,
seeing that she has always shown herself a daughter to me&mdash;that
she has all kinds of good qualities, and several accomplishments, knowing
something of conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the Dutch
style, and playing remarkably well on the guitar&mdash;not the trumpery
German thing so called&mdash;but the real Spanish guitar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His wife wrote letters for him, copied his manuscripts, and helped to
correct his proofs.&nbsp; She remained at Oulton, or Yarmouth, while
he went about; if he went to Wales or Ireland she sometimes accompanied
him to a convenient centre and there remained while he did as he pleased.&nbsp;
She admired him, and she appears to have become essential to his life,
apart from her income, and not to have resented her position at any
time, though grieved by his unconcealed melancholy.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>A
second time he praised her in print, saying that he had an exceedingly
clever wife, and allowed her &ldquo;to buy and sell, carry money to
the bank, draw cheques, inspect and pay tradesmen&rsquo;s bills, and
transact all my real business, whilst I myself pore over old books,
walk about the shires, discoursing with Gypsies, under hedgerows, or
with sober bards&mdash;in hedge alehouses.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>CHAPTER
XIX&mdash;&ldquo;THE ZINCALI&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Borrow and his wife and stepdaughter settled at Oulton Cottage before
the spring of 1840 was over.&nbsp; This house, the property of Mrs.
Borrow, was separated from Oulton Broad only by a slope of lawn, at
the foot of which was a private boat.&nbsp; Away from the house, but
equally near lawn and water stood Borrow&rsquo;s library&mdash;a little
peaked octagonal summer house, with toplights and windows.&nbsp; The
cottage is gone, but the summer house, now mantled with ivy, where he
wrote &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; is
still to be seen.&nbsp; Here, too, he arranged and completed the book
written &ldquo;at considerable intervals during a period of nearly five
years passed in Spain&mdash;in moments snatched from more important
pursuits&mdash;chiefly in ventas and pos&aacute;das (inns), whilst wandering
through the country in the arduous and unthankful task of distributing
the Gospel among its children,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Zincali: or the
Gypsies of Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was published in April, 1841.</p>
<p>This book is a description of Gypsies in Spain and wherever else
he has met them, with some history, and, as Borrow says himself, with
&ldquo;more facts than theories.&rdquo;&nbsp; It abounds in quotations
from out of the way Spanish books, but was by far &ldquo;less the result
of reading than of close observation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is patched together
from scattered notes with little order or proportion, and cannot be
regarded as a whole either in intention or effect.&nbsp; Nor is this
wholly due to the odd times and places in which it was written.&nbsp;
Borrow had never before written a continuous original work of any length.&nbsp;
He had formed no clear idea of <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>himself,
his public, or his purpose.&nbsp; Personality was strong in him and
it had to be expressed.&nbsp; He was full also of extraordinary observation,
and this he could not afford to conceal.&nbsp; It was not easy to satisfy
the two needs in one coherent book; he hardly tried, and he certainly
did not succeed.&nbsp; Ford described it well in his review of &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo;: <a name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148">{148}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Gypsies of Spain&rsquo; was a Spanish olla&mdash;a
hotchpotch of the jockey tramper, philologist, and missionary.&nbsp;
It was a thing of shreds and patches&mdash;a true book of Spain; the
chapters, like her bundle of unamalgamating provinces, were just held
together, and no more, by the common tie of religion; yet it was strange
and richly flavoured with genuine <i>borracha</i>.&nbsp; It was the
first work of a diffident, inexperienced man, who, mistrusting his own
powers, hoped to conciliate critics by leaning on Spanish historians
and Gypsy poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; is a book that is still valuable
for these two separate elements of personality and extraordinary observation.&nbsp;
Probably Borrow, his publisher, and the public, regarded it chiefly
as a work of information, picturesquely diversified, and this it still
is, though the increase and systematization of Gypsy studies are said
to have superseded it.&nbsp; A book of spirit cannot be superseded.&nbsp;
But pure information does not live long, and the fact that its information
is inaccurate or incomplete does not rot a book like &ldquo;The Compleat
Angler&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Georgics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it may happen
that the first book on a subject is the best, and its successors mere
treatises destined to pave the way for other treatises.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Gypsies of Spain&rdquo; is still read as no other book on the Gypsy
is read.&nbsp; It is still read, not only by those just infected with
Gypsy fever, but by men as men.&nbsp; It does not, indeed, <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>survive
as a whole, because it never was a whole, but there is a spirit in the
best parts sufficiently strong to carry the reader on over the rest.</p>
<p>To-day very few will do more than smile when Borrow says of the Gypsies,
that there can be no doubt &ldquo;they are human beings and have immortal
souls,&rdquo; and that the chief object of his book is to &ldquo;draw
the attention of the Christian philanthropist towards them, especially
that degraded and unhappy portion of them, the Gitanos of Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1841 many of the Christian public probably felt a slight glow of
satisfaction at starting on a book that brought the then certain millenium,
of a Christian and English cast, definitely nearer.&nbsp; Probably they
liked to know that this missionary called pugilistic combats &ldquo;disgraceful
and brutalising exhibitions&rdquo;; and they were almost as certainly,
as we are to-day, delighted with the descriptions that followed, because
it brought for the first time clearly before them a real prize-fighting
scene, and the author, a terrible child of fourteen, looking on&mdash;&ldquo;why
should I hide the truth?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; This excellent moral
tone accompanied the reader of 1841 with satisfaction to the end.&nbsp;
For example, Borrow describes the Gypsies at Tarifa swindling a country
man and woman out of their donkey.&nbsp; When he sees them being treated
and fondled by their intending robbers, he exclaims: &ldquo;Behold,
poor humanity, thought I to myself, in the hands of devils; in this
manner are human souls ensnared to destruction by the fiends of the
pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he sees them departing penniless and without
their donkey, the woman bitterly lamenting it, he comments: &ldquo;Upon
the whole, however, I did not much pity them.&nbsp; The woman was certainly
not the man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; The labourer had probably left his village
with some strolling harlot, bringing with him the animal which had previously
served to support himself and a family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow was a man
who pronounced the Bible to be &ldquo;the wonderful Book which <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>is
capable of resolving every mystery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a man, furthermore,
who called sorcery simply &ldquo;a thing impossible,&rdquo; and thus
addressed a writer on chiromancy: &ldquo;We . . . believe that the lines
of the hand have as little connection with the events of life as with
the liver and stomach, notwithstanding Aristotle, who you forget was
a heathen and cared as little for the Scriptures as the Gitanos, whether
male or female.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another satisfactory side to Borrow&rsquo;s public character, as
revealed in &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; was his contempt for &ldquo;other
nations,&rdquo; such as Spain&mdash;&ldquo;a country whose name has
long and justly been considered as synonymous with every species of
ignorance and barbarism.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice rises when he says that
&ldquo;avarice has always been the dominant passion in Spanish minds,
their rage for money being only to be compared to the wild hunger of
wolves for horseflesh in the time of winter; next to avarice, envy of
superior talent and accomplishment is the prevailing passion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These were the people whom he had gone to convert.&nbsp; His contempt
for those who were not middle-class Englishmen seemed unmitigated.&nbsp;
Speaking of the Gypsies, to whom the schools were open and the laws
kinder, he points out that, nevertheless, they remain jockeys and blacksmiths,
though it is true they have in part given up their wandering life.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;much,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will have been accomplished
if, after the lapse of a hundred years, one hundred human beings shall
have been evolved from the Gypsy stock who shall prove sober, honest,
and useful members of society,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, resembling the Spaniards
whom he so condemned.</p>
<p>But if men love a big fellow at the street corner bellowing about
sin and the wrath to come, they love him better if he was a black sinner
before he became white as the driven snow.&nbsp; Borrow reprimanded
Spaniard and Gypsy, but he also knew them: there is even a suspicion
that he <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>liked
them, though in his public black-coated capacity he had to condemn them
and regret that their destiny was perdition.&nbsp; Had he not said,
in his preface, that he had known the Gypsies for twenty years and that
they treated him well because they thought him a Gypsy? and in another
place referred to the time when he lived with the English Gypsies?&nbsp;
Had he not, in his introductions, spoken of &ldquo;my brethren, the
Smiths,&rdquo; a phrase then cryptic and only to be explained by revealing
his sworn brotherhood with Ambrose Smith, the Jasper Petulengro of later
books?&nbsp; He had said, moreover, in a perfectly genuine tone, with
no trace of missionary declamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the days of the great persecution in England against
the Gypsies, there can be little doubt that they lived a right merry
and tranquil life, wandering about and pitching their tents wherever
inclination led them: indeed, I can scarcely conceive any human condition
more enviable than Gypsy life must have been in England during the latter
part of the seventeenth, and the whole of the eighteenth century, which
were likewise the happy days for Englishmen in general; there was peace
and plenty in the land, a contented population, and everything went
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a man wishes to condemn the seven deadly sins we tolerate him
if in the process they are sufficiently well described.&nbsp; If Borrow
described the tinker family as wretched, and their donkey as miserable,
he added, &ldquo;though life, seemingly so wretched, has its charms
for these outcasts, who live without care and anxiety, without a thought
beyond the present hour, and who sleep as sound in ruined posadas and
ventas, or in ravines amongst rocks and pines, as the proudest grandee
in his palace at Seville or Madrid.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he condemned superstition,
he yet thought it possibly &ldquo;founded on a physical reality&rdquo;;
he regarded the moon as the true &ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; and bade men
&ldquo;not sleep <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>uncovered
beneath the smile of the moon, for her glance is poisonous, and produces
insupportable itching in the eye, and not infrequently blindness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If he believed in the immortality of the soul, he did not disdain to
know the vendor of poisons who was a Gypsy.&nbsp; If he stayed three
weeks in Badajoz because he knew he should never meet any people &ldquo;more
in need of a little Christian exhortation&rdquo; than the Gypsies, he
did not fill his pages with three weeks of Christian exhortation, but
told the story of the Gypsy soldier, Antonio&mdash;how he recognised
as a Gypsy the enemy who was about to kill him, and saved himself from
the uplifted bayonet by crying &ldquo;Zincalo, Zincalo!&rdquo; and then,
having been revived by him, sat for hours with his late enemy, who said:
&ldquo;Let the dogs fight and tear each other&rsquo;s throats till they
are all destroyed, what matters it to the Zincali? they are not of our
blood, and shall that be shed for them?&rdquo;&nbsp; This man who, if
he had his way, would have washed his face in the blood of the Busn&eacute;
(those who are not Gypsies), this man called Borrow &ldquo;brother!&rdquo;&nbsp;
If Borrow distributed Testaments, he knew little more of the recipients
than a bolt from the blue, or if he did he cared to tell but little.&nbsp;
That little is the story of the Gypsy soldier, Chal&eacute;co, who came
to him at Madrid in 1838 with a copy of the Testament.&nbsp; He told
his story from his cradle up; he imposed himself on Borrow&rsquo;s hospitality,
eating &ldquo;like a wolf of the Sierra,&rdquo; and drinking in proportion.&nbsp;
Borrow could only escape from him by dining out.&nbsp; When Borrow was
imprisoned the fellow drew his sword at the news and vowed to murder
the Prime Minister &ldquo;for having dared to imprison his brother.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In what follows, Borrow reveals in a consummate manner his power of
drawing into his vicinity extraordinary events:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my release, I did not revisit my lodgings for some days,
but lived at an hotel.&nbsp; I returned late one afternoon, with my
servant Francisco, a Basque of Hern&aacute;ni, who had <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>served
me with the utmost fidelity during my imprisonment, which he had voluntarily
shared with me.&nbsp; The first person I saw on entering was the Gypsy
soldier, seated by the table, whereon were several bottles of wine which
he had ordered from the tavern, of course on my account.&nbsp; He was
smoking, and looked savage and sullen; perhaps he was not much pleased
with the reception he had experienced.&nbsp; He had forced himself in,
and the woman of the house sat in a corner looking upon him with dread.&nbsp;
I addressed him, but he would scarcely return an answer.&nbsp; At last
he commenced discoursing with great volubility in Gypsy and Latin.&nbsp;
I did not understand much of what he said.&nbsp; His words were wild
and incoherent, but he repeatedly threatened some person.&nbsp; The
last bottle was now exhausted&mdash;he demanded more.&nbsp; I told him
in a gentle manner that he had drunk enough.&nbsp; He looked on the
ground for some time, then slowly, and somewhat hesitatingly, drew his
sword and laid it on the table.&nbsp; It was become dark.&nbsp; I was
not afraid of the fellow, but I wished to avoid any thing unpleasant.&nbsp;
I called to Francisco to bring lights, and obeying a sign which I made
him, he sat down at the table.&nbsp; The Gypsy glared fiercely upon
him&mdash;Francisco laughed, and began with great glee to talk in Basque,
of which the Gypsy understood not a word.&nbsp; The Basques, like all
Tartars, and such they are, are paragons of fidelity and good nature;
they are only dangerous when outraged, when they are terrible indeed.&nbsp;
Francisco to the strength of a giant joined the disposition of a lamb.&nbsp;
He was beloved even in the patio of the prison, where he used to pitch
the bar and wrestle with the murderers and felons, always coming off
victor.&nbsp; He continued speaking Basque.&nbsp; The Gypsy was incensed;
and, forgetting the languages in which, for the last hour, he had been
speaking, complained to Francisco of his rudeness in speaking any tongue
but Castilian.&nbsp; The Basque <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>replied
by a loud carcaj&aacute;da, and slightly touched the Gypsy on the knee.&nbsp;
The latter sprang up like a mine discharged, seized his sword, and,
retreating a few steps, made a desperate lunge at Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Basques, next to the Pasiegos, are the best cudgel-players
in Spain, and in the world.&nbsp; Francisco held in his hand part of
a broomstick, which he had broken in the stable, whence he had just
ascended.&nbsp; With the swiftness of lightning he foiled the stroke
of Chal&eacute;co, and, in another moment, with a dexterous blow, struck
the sword out of his hand, sending it ringing against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsy resumed his seat and his cigar.&nbsp; He occasionally
looked at the Basque.&nbsp; His glances were at first atrocious, but
presently changed their expression, and appeared to me to become prying
and eagerly curious.&nbsp; He at last arose, picked up his sword, sheathed
it, and walked slowly to the door, when there he stopped, turned round,
advanced close to Francisco, and looked him steadfastly in the face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am a Gypsy, and can
read baji.&nbsp; Do you know where you will be this time to-morrow?&rsquo;
<a name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154">{154}</a>&nbsp; Then
laughing like a hyena, he departed, and I never saw him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time on the morrow, Francisco was on his death-bed.&nbsp;
He had caught the jail fever, which had long raged in the Carcel de
la Corte, where I was imprisoned.&nbsp; In a few days he was buried,
a mass of corruption, in the Campo Santo of Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having attracted the event, he recorded it with a vividness well
set off by his own nonchalance.&nbsp; Again and again he was to repeat
this triumph of depicting the wild, and the wild in a condition of activity
and often fury.</p>
<p>His success is all the greater because it is unexpected.&nbsp; He
sets out &ldquo;to direct the attention of the public towards <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the
Gypsies; but he hopes to be able to do so without any romantic appeals
on their behalf.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is far from having a romantic tone.&nbsp;
He wields, as a rule, with any amount of dignity the massive style of
the early Victorian &ldquo;Quarterly Review&rdquo; and Lane&rsquo;s
so-called &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, speaking of Gypsy
fortune-tellers, he says: &ldquo;Their practice chiefly lies among females,
the portion of the human race most given to curiosity and credulity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sentences like this always remind me of Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s indignation
at the thought of religion intruding on private life.&nbsp; His indignation
is obviously of the same period as the sentence: &ldquo;Among the Zingari
are not a few who deal in precious stones, and some who vend poisons;
and the most remarkable individual whom it has been my fortune to encounter
amongst the Gypsies, whether of the Eastern or Western world, was a
person who dealt in both these articles.&rdquo;&nbsp; A style like this
resembles a paunchy man who can be relied on not to pick the daisies.&nbsp;
At times Borrow writes as if he were translating, as in &ldquo;The anvil
rings beneath the thundering stroke, hour succeeds hour, and still endures
the hard sullen toil.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds a little vanity of no value
by a Biblical echo now and again, as in the clause: &ldquo;And it came
to pass, moreover, that the said Fajardo . . . &rdquo; or in &ldquo;And
the chief of that camp, even Mr. Petulengro, stood before the encampment.
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a style for information, instruction, edification, and intervals
of sleep.&nbsp; It is the style of an age, a class, a sect, not of an
individual.&nbsp; Deeds and not words are what count in it.&nbsp; Only
by big, wild, or extraordinary things can it be compelled to a semblance
of life.&nbsp; Borrow gives it such things a hundred times, and they
help one another to be effective.&nbsp; The reader does not forget the
Gypsies of Granada:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of them reside in caves scooped in the sides of <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>the
ravines which lead to the higher regions of the Alpujarras, on a skirt
of which stands Granada.&nbsp; A common occupation of the Gitanos of
Granada is working in iron, and it is not infrequent to find these caves
tenanted by Gypsy smiths and their families, who ply the hammer and
forge in the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; To one standing at the mouth
of the cave, especially at night, they afford a picturesque spectacle.&nbsp;
Gathered round the forge, their bronzed and naked bodies, illuminated
by the flame, appear like figures of demons; while the cave, with its
flinty sides and uneven roof, blackened by the charcoal vapours which
hover about it in festoons, seems to offer no inadequate representation
of fabled purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture of the Gitana of Seville hands on some of its own power
to the quieter pages, and at length, with a score of other achievements
of the same solid kind, kindles well-nigh every part of the shapeless
book.&nbsp; I shall quote it at length:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there be one being in the world who, more than another,
deserves the title of sorceress (and where do you find a word of greater
romance and more thrilling interest?), it is the Gypsy female in the
prime and vigour of her age and ripeness of her understanding&mdash;the
Gipsy wife, the mother of two or three children.&nbsp; Mention to me
a point of devilry with which that woman is not acquainted.&nbsp; She
can at any time, when it suits her, show herself as expert a jockey
as her husband, and he appears to advantage in no other character, and
is only eloquent when descanting on the merits of some particular animal;
but she can do much more; she is a prophetess, though she believes not
in prophecy; she is a physician, though she will not taste her own philters;
she is a procuress, though she is not to be procured; she is a singer
of obscene songs, though she will suffer no obscene hands to touch her;
and though no one is more tenacious of the little she possesses, <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>she
is a cutpurse and a shoplifter whenever opportunity shall offer. . .
. Observe, for example, the Gitana, even her of Seville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is standing before the portals of a large house in one
of the narrow Moorish streets of the capital of Andalusia; through the
grated iron door, she looks in upon the court; it is paved with small
marble slabs of almost snowy whiteness; in the middle is a fountain
distilling limpid water, and all around there is a profusion of macetas,
in which flowering plants and aromatic shrubs are growing, and at each
corner there is an orange tree, and the perfume of the azah&aacute;r
may be distinguished; you hear the melody of birds from a small aviary
beneath the piazza which surrounds the court, which is surrounded by
a toldo or linen awning, for it is the commencement of May, and the
glorious sun of Andalusia is burning with a splendour too intense for
its rays to be borne with impunity.&nbsp; It is a fairy scene such as
nowhere meets the eye but at Seville, or perhaps at Fez and Shiraz,
in the palaces of the Sultan and the Shah.&nbsp; The Gypsy looks through
the iron-grated door, and beholds, seated near the fountain, a richly
dressed dame and two lovely delicate maidens; they are busied at their
morning&rsquo;s occupation, intertwining with their sharp needles the
gold and silk on the tambour; several female attendants are seated behind.&nbsp;
The Gypsy pulls the bell, when is heard the soft cry of &lsquo;Quien
es&rsquo;; the door, unlocked by means of a string, recedes upon its
hinges, when in walks the Gitana, the witch-wife of Multan, with a look
such as the tiger-cat casts when she stealeth from her jungle into the
plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well may you exclaim, &lsquo;Ave Maria purissima,&rsquo;
ye dames and maidens of Seville, as she advances towards you; she is
not of yourselves, she is not of your blood, she or her fathers have
walked to your clime from a distance of three thousand leagues.&nbsp;
She has come from the far <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>East,
like the three enchanted kings to Cologne; but unlike them she and her
race have come with hate and not with love.&nbsp; She comes to flatter,
and to deceive, and to rob, for she is a lying prophetess, and a she-Thug;
she will greet you with blessings which will make your heart rejoice,
but your heart&rsquo;s blood would freeze, could you hear the curses
which to herself she murmurs against you; for she says, that in her
children&rsquo;s veins flows the dark blood of the &lsquo;husbands,&rsquo;
whilst in those of yours flows the pale tide of the &lsquo;savages,&rsquo;
and therefore she would gladly set her foot on all your corses first
poisoned by her hands.&nbsp; For all her love&mdash;and she can love&mdash;is
for the Romas; and all her hate&mdash;and who can hate like her?&mdash;is
for the Busnees; for she says that the world would be a fair world were
there no Busnees, and if the Romamiks could heat their kettles undisturbed
at the foot of the olive trees; and therefore she would kill them all
if she could and if she dared.&nbsp; She never seeks the houses of the
Busnees but for the purpose of prey; for the wild animals of the sierra
do not more abhor the sight of man than she abhors the countenances
of the Busnees.&nbsp; She now comes to prey upon you and to scoff at
you.&nbsp; Will you believe her words?&nbsp; Fools! do you think that
the being before ye has any sympathy for the like of you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is of the middle stature, neither strongly nor slightly
built, and yet her every movement denotes agility and vigour.&nbsp;
As she stands erect before you, she appears like a falcon about to soar,
and you are almost tempted to believe that the power of volation is
hers; and were you to stretch forth your hand to seize her, she would
spring above the house-tops like a bird.&nbsp; Her face is oval, and
her features are regular but somewhat hard and coarse, for she was born
amongst rocks in a thicket, and she has been wind-beaten and sun-scorched
for many a year, even like her parents before her; there is many a speck
upon her cheek, and <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>perhaps
a scar, but no dimples of love; and her brow is wrinkled over, though
she is yet young.&nbsp; Her complexion is more than dark, for it is
almost that of a Mulatto; and her hair, which hangs in long locks on
either side of her face, is black as coal, and coarse as the tail of
a horse, from which it seems to have been gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no female eye in Seville can support the glance of
hers, so fierce and penetrating, and yet so artful and sly, is the expression
of their dark orbs; her mouth is fine and almost delicate, and there
is not a queen on the proudest throne between Madrid and Moscow who
might not, and would not, envy the white and even rows of teeth which
adorn it, which seem not of pearl but of the purest elephant&rsquo;s
bone of Multan.&nbsp; She comes not alone; a swarthy two-year old bantling
clasps her neck with one arm, its naked body half extant from the coarse
blanket which, drawn round her shoulders, is secured at her bosom by
a skewer.&nbsp; Though tender of age it looks wicked and sly, like a
veritable imp of Roma.&nbsp; Huge rings of false gold dangle from wide
slits in the lobes of her ears; her nether garments are rags, and her
feet are cased in hempen sandals.&nbsp; Such is the wandering Gitana,
such is the witch-wife of Multan, who has come to spae the fortune of
the Sevillian countess and her daughters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O may the blessing of Egypt light upon your head, you
high-born Lady!&nbsp; (May an evil end overtake your body, daughter
of a Busnee harlot!) and may the same blessing await the two fair roses
of the Nile here flowering by your side!&nbsp; (May evil Moors seize
them and carry them across the water!)&nbsp; O listen to the words of
the poor woman who is come from a distant country; she is of a wise
people, though it has pleased the God of the sky to punish them for
their sins by sending them to wander through the world.&nbsp; They denied
shelter to the Majari, whom you call the queen of heaven, and to the
Son of God, <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>when
they flew to the land of Egypt, before the wrath of the wicked king;
it is said that they even refused them a draught of the sweet waters
of the great river when the blessed two were athirst.&nbsp; O you will
say that it was a heavy crime; and truly so it was, and heavily has
the Lord punished the Egyptians.&nbsp; He has sent us a-wandering, poor
as you see, with scarcely a blanket to cover us.&nbsp; O blessed lady
(accursed be thy dead as many as thou mayest have), we have no money
to purchase us bread; we have only our wisdom with which to support
ourselves and our poor hungry babes; when God took away their silks
from the Egyptians, and their gold from the Egyptians, he left them
their wisdom as a resource that they might not starve.&nbsp; O who can
read the stars like the Egyptians? and who can read the lines of the
palm like the Egyptians?&nbsp; The poor woman read in the stars that
there was a rich ventura for all of this goodly house, so she followed
the bidding of the stars and came to declare it.&nbsp; O blessed lady
(I defile thy dead corse), your husband is at Granada, fighting with
King Ferdinand against the wild Corahai!&nbsp; (May an evil ball smite
him and split his head!)&nbsp; Within three months he shall return with
twenty captive Moors, round the neck of each a chain of gold.&nbsp;
(God grant that when he enter the house a beam may fall upon him and
crush him!)&nbsp; And within nine months after his return God shall
bless you with a fair chabo, the pledge for which you have sighed so
long!&nbsp; (Accursed be the salt placed in its mouth in the church
when it is baptized!)&nbsp; Your palm, blessed lady, your palm, and
the palms of all I see here, that I may tell you all the rich ventura
which is hanging over this good house; (May evil lightning fall upon
it and consume it!) but first let me sing you a song of Egypt, that
the spirit of the Chowahanee may descend more plenteously upon the poor
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her demeanour now instantly undergoes a change.&nbsp; Hitherto
she has been pouring forth a lying and wild <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>harangue,
without much flurry or agitation of manner.&nbsp; Her speech, it is
true, has been rapid, but her voice has never been raised to a very
high key; but she now stamps on the ground, and placing her hands on
her hips, she moves quickly to the right and left, advancing and retreating
in a sidelong direction.&nbsp; Her glances become more fierce and fiery,
and her coarse hair stands erect on her head, stiff as the prickles
of the hedgehog; and now she commences clapping her hands, and uttering
words of an unknown tongue, to a strange and uncouth tune.&nbsp; The
tawny bantling seems inspired with the same fiend, and, foaming at the
mouth, utters wild sounds, in imitation of its dam.&nbsp; Still more
rapid become the sidelong movements of the Gitana.&nbsp; Movements!
she springs, she bounds, and at every bound she is a yard above the
ground.&nbsp; She no longer bears the child in her bosom; she plucks
it from thence, and fiercely brandishes it aloft, till at last, with
a yell, she tosses it high into the air, like a ball, and then, with
neck and head thrown back, receives it, as it falls, on her hands and
breast, extracting a cry from the terrified beholders.&nbsp; Is it possible
she can be singing?&nbsp; Yes, in the wildest style of her people; and
here is a snatch of the song, in the language of Roma, which she occasionally
screams:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;En los sastos de yesque plai me diqu&eacute;lo,<br />
Doscusa&ntilde;as de sonacai ter&eacute;lo,&mdash;<br />
Corojai diqu&eacute;lo abillar,<br />
Y ne asislo chapescar, chapescar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the top of a mountain I stand,<br />
With a crown of red gold in my hand,&mdash;<br />
Wild Moors come trooping o&rsquo;er the lea,<br />
O how from their fury shall I flee, flee, flee?<br />
O how from their fury shall I flee?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the Gitana in the days of Ferdinand and Isabella, and much
the same is she now in the days of Isabel and Christina. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, it is true, there is a substantial richly-coloured and <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>strange
subject matter, such as could hardly be set down in any way or by anyone
without attracting the attention.&nbsp; Borrow makes it do more than
this.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;extant&rdquo; may offend a little, but the
writer can afford many such blemishes, for he has life in his pen.&nbsp;
He is, as it were himself substantial, richly-coloured, strange and
with big strokes and splashes he suggests the thing itself.&nbsp; There
have been writers since Borrow&rsquo;s day who have thought to use words
so subtly that they are equivalent to things, but in the end their words
remain nothing but words.&nbsp; Borrow uses language like a man, and
we forget his words on account of the vividness of the things which
they do not so much create as evoke.&nbsp; I do not mean that it can
be called unconscious art, for it is naively conscious and delighting
in itself.&nbsp; The language is that of an orator, a man standing up
and addressing a mass in large and emphatic terms.&nbsp; He succeeds
not only in evoking things that are very much alive, but in suggesting
an artist that is their equal, instead of one, who like so many more
refined writers, is a more or less pathetic admirer of living things.&nbsp;
In this he resembles Byron.&nbsp; It may not be the highest form of
art, but it is the most immediate and disturbing and genial in its effect.&nbsp;
Finally, the whole book has body.&nbsp; It can be browsed on.&nbsp;
It does not ask a particular mood, being itself the result of no one
mood, but of a great part of one man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Turn over half
a dozen pages and a story, or a picture, or a bit of costume, or of
superstition, will invariably be the reward.&nbsp; It reads already
like a book rather older than it really is, but not because it has faded.&nbsp;
There was nothing in it to fade, being too hard, massive and unvarnished.&nbsp;
It remains alive, capable of surviving the Gypsies except in so far
as they live within it and its fellow books.</p>
<h2><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>CHAPTER
XX&mdash;&ldquo;THE BIBLE IN SPAIN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; Borrow used some of his private notes
and others supplied by Spanish friends, together with parts of letters
to the Bible Society.&nbsp; It used to be supposed that &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain&rdquo; was made up almost entirely from these letters.&nbsp;
But this has now been disproved by the newly published &ldquo;Letters
of George Borrow to the Bible Society.&rdquo; <a name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a">{163a}</a>&nbsp;
These letters are about half the length of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo;
and yet only about a third part of them was used by Borrow in writing
that book.&nbsp; Some of his letters were never received by the Society
and had probably been lost on the way.&nbsp; But this was more of a
disaster to the Society than to Borrow.&nbsp; He kept journals <a name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b">{163b}</a>
from which his letters were probably copied or composed; and he was
able, for example, in July, 1836, to send the Society a detailed and
dated account of his entry into Spain in January, and his intercourse
with the Gypsies of Badajoz.&nbsp; It is also possible that the letters
lent to him by the Society were far more numerous than those returned
by him.&nbsp; He missed little that could have been turned to account,
unless it was the suggestion that if he knew the country his safest
way from Seville to Madrid was to go afoot in the dress of beggar or
Gypsy, and the remark that in Tangier one of his principal associates
was a black slave, whose country was only three days journey from Timbuctoo.
<a name="citation163c"></a><a href="#footnote163c">{163c}</a>&nbsp;
He had already in 1835 <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>planned
to write &ldquo;a small volume&rdquo; on what he was about to see and
hear in Spain, and it must have been from notes or full journals kept
with this view that he drew for &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; and still
more for &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote his journals
and letters very much as Cobbett his &ldquo;Rural Rides,&rdquo; straight
after days in the saddle.&nbsp; Except when he was presenting a matter
of pure business he was not much troubled by the fact that he was addressing
his employers, the Bible Society.&nbsp; He did not always begin &ldquo;Bible&rdquo;
with a capital B, an error corrected by Mr. Darlow, his editor.&nbsp;
He prefixed &ldquo;Revd. and dear sir,&rdquo; and thought little more
about them unless to add such a phrase as: &ldquo;A fact which I hope
I may be permitted to mention with gladness and with decent triumph
in the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not, however, scorn to make a favourable
misrepresentation of his success, as for example in the interview with
Mendizabal, which was reduced probably to the level of the facts in
its book form.&nbsp; The Society were not always pleased with his frankness
and confidence, and the Secretary complained of things which were inconvenient
to be read aloud in a pious assembly, less concerned with sinners than
with repentance, and not easily convinced by the improbable.&nbsp; He
sent them, for example, after a specimen Gypsy translation of the Gospel
of St. Luke and of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;sixteen specimens
of the horrid curses in use amongst the Spanish Gypsies,&rdquo; with
translations into English.&nbsp; These do not re-appear either in &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo; or in the edition of Borrow&rsquo;s letters to
the Society.&nbsp; He spared them, apparently, the story of Benedict
Moll and many another good thing that was meant for mankind.</p>
<p>I should be inclined to think that a very great part of &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo; was written as the letters were, on the spot.&nbsp;
Either it was not sent to the Society for fear of loss, or if copied
and sent to them, it was lost on the way or never returned by Borrow
after he had used it in writing the <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>book,
for the letters are just as careful in most parts as the book, and the
book is just as fresh as the letters.&nbsp; When he wrote to the Society,
he said that he told the schoolmaster &ldquo;the Almighty would never
have inspired His saints with a desire to write what was unintelligible
to the great mass of mankind&rdquo;; in &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo;
he said: &ldquo;It [<i>i.e.</i>, the Bible] would never have been written
if not calculated by itself to illume the minds of all classes of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Continuous letters or journals would be more likely to suit Borrow&rsquo;s
purpose than notes such as he took in his second tour to Wales and never
used.&nbsp; Notes made on the spot are very likely to be disproportionate,
to lay undue stress on something that should be allowed to recede, and
would do so if left to memory; and once made they are liable to misinterpretation
if used after intervals of any length.&nbsp; But the flow and continuity
of letters insist on some proportion and on truth at least to the impression
of the day, and a balance is ensured between the scene or the experience
on the one hand and the observer on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was not published before Borrow realised
what a treasure he had deposited with the Bible Society, and not long
afterwards he obtained the loan of his letters to make a new book on
his travels in Spain.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s own account, in his preface
to the second edition of &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; is that the success
of that book, and &ldquo;the voice not only of England but of the greater
part of Europe&rdquo; proclaiming it, astonished him in his &ldquo;humble
retreat&rdquo; at Oulton.&nbsp; He was, he implies, inclined to be too
much elated.&nbsp; Then the voice of a critic&mdash;whom we know to
have been Richard Ford&mdash;told him not to believe all he heard, but
to try again and avoid all his second hand stuff, his &ldquo;Gypsy poetry,
dry laws, and compilations from dull Spanish authors.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
so, he says, he began work in the winter, but slowly, and on through
summer and autumn and another <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>winter,
and into another spring and summer, loitering and being completely idle
at times, until at last he went to his summer house daily and finished
the book.&nbsp; But as a matter of fact &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; had
no great success in either public or literary esteem, and Ford&rsquo;s
criticism was passed on the manuscript, not the printed book.</p>
<p>Borrow and his wife took about six months to prepare the letters
for publication as a book.&nbsp; He took great pains with the writing
and only worked when he was in the mood.&nbsp; His health was not quite
good, as he implies in the preface to &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; and
he tried &ldquo;the water system&rdquo; and also &ldquo;lessons in singing,&rdquo;
to cure his indigestion and sleeplessness.&nbsp; He had the advantage
of Ford&rsquo;s advice, to avoid fine writing, mere description, poetry
and learned books, and to give plenty of &ldquo;racy, real, genuine
scenes, and the more out of the way the better,&rdquo; stories of adventure,
extraordinary things, prisons, low life, Gypsies, and so on.&nbsp; He
was now drawing entirely from &ldquo;his own well,&rdquo; and when the
book was out Ford took care to remark that the author had cast aside
the learned books which he had used as swimming corks in the &ldquo;Zincali,&rdquo;
and now &ldquo;leaped boldly into the tide&rdquo; unaided.&nbsp; John
Murray&rsquo;s reader sent back the manuscript to be revised and augmented,
and after this was done, &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; was published,
at the end of 1842, when Borrow was thirty-nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; was praised and moreover purchased
by everyone.&nbsp; It was translated into French, American, Russian,
and printed in America.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo; found
it a &ldquo;genuine book&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Examiner&rdquo; said that
&ldquo;apart from its adventurous interest, its literary merit is extraordinary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ford compared it with an old Spanish ballad, &ldquo;going from incident
to incident, bang, bang, bang!&rdquo; and with Gil Blas, and with Bunyan.&nbsp;
Ford, it must be remembered, had ridden over the same tracks as Borrow
in Spain, but before him, and had written his own <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>book
with a combination of learning and gusto that is one of the rarest of
literary virtues.&nbsp; Like Borrow he wrote fresh from the thing itself
when possible, asserting for example that the fat of the hams of Montanches,
when boiled, &ldquo;looked like melted topazes, and the flavour defies
language, although we have dined on one this very day, in order to secure
accuracy and undeniable prose.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the benefit of the public
Ford pointed out that &ldquo;the Bible and its distribution have been
<i>the</i> business of his existence; whenever moral darkness brooded,
there, the Bible in his hand, he forced his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Borrow was actually in Spain he was much influenced by the conditions
of the moment.&nbsp; The sun of Spain would shine so that he prized
it above English civilization.&nbsp; The anarchy and wildness of Spain
at another time would make him hate both men and land.&nbsp; But more
lasting than joy in the sun and misery at the sight of misery was the
feeling that he was &ldquo;adrift in Spain, the land of old renown,
the land of wonder and mystery, with better opportunities of becoming
acquainted with its strange secrets and peculiarities than, perhaps,
ever yet were afforded to any individual, certainly to a foreigner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When he entered it, by crossing a brook, out of Portugal, he shouted
the Spanish battle-cry in ecstasy, and in the end he described his five
years in Spain as, &ldquo;if not the most eventful&rdquo;&mdash;he cannot
refrain from that vainglorious dark hint&mdash;yet &ldquo;the most happy
years&rdquo; of his existence.&nbsp; Spain was to him &ldquo;the most
magnificent country in the world&rdquo;: it was also &ldquo;one of the
few countries in Europe where poverty is not treated with contempt,
and I may add, where the wealthy are not blindly idolized.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His book is a song of wild Spain when Spain <i>was</i> Spain.</p>
<p>Borrow, as we already know, had in him many of the powers that go
to make a great book, yet &ldquo;The Zincali&rdquo; was not a great
book.&nbsp; The important power developed <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>or
employed later which made &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; a great book
was the power of narrative.&nbsp; The writing of those letters from
Spain to the Bible Society had taught him or discovered in him the instinct
for proportion and connection which is the simplest, most inexplicable
and most essential of literary gifts.&nbsp; With the help of this he
could write narrative that should suggest and represent the continuity
of life.&nbsp; He could pause for description or dialogue or reflection
without interrupting this stream of life.&nbsp; Nothing need be, and
nothing was, alien to the narrator with this gift; for his writing would
now assimilate everything and enrich itself continually.</p>
<p>The reader could follow, as he preferred, the Bible distribution
in particular, or the Gypsies, or Borrow himself, through the long ways
and dense forests of the book, and through the moral darkness of Spain.&nbsp;
It could be treated as a pious book, and as such it was attacked by
Catholics, as &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; still is.&nbsp; For certainly Borrow
made no secret of his piety.&nbsp; When &ldquo;a fine young man of twenty-seven,
the only son of a widowed mother . . . the best sailor on board, and
beloved by all who were acquainted with him&rdquo; was swept off the
ship in which Borrow was sailing, and drowned, as he had dreamed he
would be, the author exclaimed: &ldquo;Truly wonderful are the ways
of Providence!&rdquo;&nbsp; When a Spanish schoolmaster suggested that
the Testament was unintelligible without notes, Borrow informed him
that on the contrary the notes were far more difficult, and &ldquo;it
would never have been written if not calculated of itself to illume
the minds of all classes of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bible was, in
his published words, &ldquo;the well-head of all that is useful and
conducive to the happiness of society&rdquo;; and he told the poor Catalans
that their souls&rsquo; welfare depended on their being acquainted with
the book he was selling at half the cost price.&nbsp; He could write
not unlike the author of &ldquo;The Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo;
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>as
when he exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh man, man, seek not to dive into the mystery
of moral good and evil; confess thyself a worm, cast thyself on the
earth, and murmur with thy lips in the dust, Jesus, Jesus!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He thought the Pope &ldquo;the head minister of Satan here on earth,&rdquo;
and inspired partly by contempt of Catholics, he declared that &ldquo;no
people in the world entertain sublimer notions of the uncreated eternal
God than the Moors . . . and with respect to Christ, their ideas even
of Him are much more just than those of the Papists.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he said to the face of the Spanish Prime Minister: &ldquo;It is a pleasant
thing to be persecuted for the Gospel&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor
was this pure cant; for he meant at least this, that he loved conflict
and would be fearless and stubborn in battle; and, as he puts it, he
was &ldquo;cast into prison for the Gospel&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1843, no doubt, what first recommended this book to so many thousands
was the Protestant fervour and purpose of the book, and the romantic
reputation of Spain.&nbsp; At this day Borrow&rsquo;s Bible distribution
is mainly of antiquarian and sectarian interest.&nbsp; We should not
estimate the darkness of Madrid by the number of Testaments there in
circulation and daily use, nor on the other hand should we fear, like
Borrow, to bring them into contempt by making them too common.&nbsp;
Yet his missionary work makes the necessary backbone of the book.&nbsp;
He was, as he justly said, &ldquo;no tourist, no writer of books of
travels.&rdquo;&nbsp; His work brought him adventure as no mere wandering
could have done.&nbsp; What is more, the man&rsquo;s methods are still
entertaining to those who care nothing about the distribution itself.&nbsp;
Where he found the remains of a robber&rsquo;s camp he left a New Testament
and some tracts.&nbsp; To carry the Bibles over the flinty hills of
Galicia and the Asturias he bought &ldquo;a black Andalusian stallion
of great power and strength, . . . unbroke, savage and furious&rdquo;:
the cargo, he says, would tame the animal.&nbsp; He fixed his advertisement
on the <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>church
porch at Pitiegua, announcing the sale of Testaments at Salamanca.&nbsp;
He had the courage without the ferocity of enthusiasm, and in the cause
of the Bible Society he saw and did things which little concerned it,
which in fact displeased it, but keep this book alive with a great stir
and shout of life, with a hundred pages where we are shown what the
poet meant by &ldquo;forms more real than living men.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
are shown the unrighteous to the very life.&nbsp; What matters it then
if the author professes the opinion that &ldquo;the friendship of the
unrighteous is never of long duration&rdquo;?&nbsp; Nevertheless, these
pious ejaculations are not without their value in the composition of
the author&rsquo;s amazing character.</p>
<p>Borrow came near to being a perfect traveller.&nbsp; For he was,
on the one hand, a man whose individuality was carved in clear bold
lines, who had a manner and a set of opinions as remarkable as his appearance.&nbsp;
Thus he was bound to come into conflict with men wherever he went: he
would bring out their manners and opinions, if they had any.&nbsp; But
on the other hand he had abounding curiosity.&nbsp; He was bold but
not rude: on the contrary he was most vigilantly polite.&nbsp; He took
snuff, though he detested it; he avoided politics as much as possible:
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have lived too long with <i>Romany
chals and Petulengres</i> to be of any politics save Gypsy politics,&rdquo;
in spite of what he had said in &rsquo;32 and was to say again in &rsquo;57.&nbsp;
When he and the Gypsy Antonio came to Jaraicejo they separated by Antonio&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; The Gypsy got through the town unchallenged by the guard,
though not unnoticed by the townspeople.&nbsp; But Borrow was stopped
and asked by a man of the National Guard whether he came with the Gypsy,
to which he answered, &ldquo;Do I look a person likely to keep company
with Gypsies?&rdquo; though, says he, he probably did.&nbsp; Then the
National asked for his passport:</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&ldquo;I
remembered having read that the best way to win a Spaniard&rsquo;s heart
is to treat him with ceremonious civility.&nbsp; I therefore dismounted,
and taking off my hat, made a low bow to the constitutional soldier,
saying, &lsquo;Se&ntilde;or Nacional, you must know that I am an English
gentleman travelling in this country for my pleasure.&nbsp; I bear a
passport, which on inspecting you will find to be perfectly regular.&nbsp;
It was given me by the great Lord Palmerston, Minister of England, whom
you of course have heard of here.&nbsp; At the bottom you will see his
own handwriting.&nbsp; Look at it and rejoice; perhaps you will never
have another opportunity.&nbsp; As I put unbounded confidence in the
honour of every gentleman, I leave the passport in your hands whilst
I repair to the posada to refresh myself.&nbsp; When you have inspected
it, you will perhaps oblige me so far as to bring it to me.&nbsp; Cavalier,
I kiss your hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then made him another low bow, which he returned with one
still lower, and leaving him now staring at the passport and now looking
at myself, I went into a posada, to which I was directed by a beggar
whom I met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fed the horse, and procured some bread and barley, as the
Gypsy had directed me.&nbsp; I likewise purchased three fine partridges
of a fowler, who was drinking wine in the posada.&nbsp; He was satisfied
with the price I gave him, and offered to treat me with a copita, to
which I made no objection.&nbsp; As we sat discoursing at the table,
the National entered with the passport in his hand, and sat down by
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>National</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Caballero, I return you your
passport; it is quite in form.&nbsp; I rejoice much to have made your
acquaintance.&nbsp; I have no doubt that you can give me some information
respecting the present war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Myself</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;I shall be very happy to afford
so polite and honourable a gentleman any information in my power.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He won the hearts of the people of Villa Seca by the &ldquo;formality&rdquo;
of his behaviour and language; for he tells us <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>that
in such remote places might still be found the gravity of deportment
and the grandiose expressions which are scoffed at as exaggerations
in the romances.&nbsp; He speaks of himself in one place as strolling
about a town or neighbourhood, entering into conversation with several
people whom he met, shopkeepers, professional men, and others.&nbsp;
Near Evora he sat down daily at a fountain and talked with everyone
who came to it.&nbsp; He visited the College of the English Catholics
at Lisbon, excusing himself, indeed, by saying that his favourite or
his only study was man.&nbsp; His knowledge of languages and his un-English
appearance made it easier for him to become familiar with many kinds
of men.&nbsp; He introduced himself among some Jews of Lisbon, and pronounced
a blessing: they took him for a powerful rabbi, and he favoured their
mistake so that in a few days he knew all that related to these people
and their traffic.&nbsp; On his journey in Galicia, when he was nearing
Finisterra, the men of the cabin where he rested took him for a Catalan,
and &ldquo;he favoured their mistake and began with a harsh Catalan
accent to talk of the fish of Galicia, and the high duties on salt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When at this same cabin he found there was no bed, he went up into the
loft and lay down on the boards&rsquo; without complaint.&nbsp; So in
the prison at Madrid he got on so well with the prisoners that on the
third day he spoke their language as if he were &ldquo;a son of the
prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Gibraltar he talked to the man of Mogador in
Arabic and was taken for &ldquo;a holy man from the kingdoms of the
East,&rdquo; especially when he produced the shekel which had been given
him by Hasfeldt: a Jew there believed him to be a Salamancan Jew.&nbsp;
At Villafranca a woman mistook his voice in the dark for that of &ldquo;the
German clockmaker from Pontevedra.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some time in 1839
he went among the villages dressed in a peasant&rsquo;s leather helmet,
jacket and trousers, and resembling &ldquo;a person between sixty and
<!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>seventy
years of age,&rdquo; so that people addressed him as Uncle, and bought
his Testaments, though the Bible Society, on hearing it, &ldquo;began
to inquire whether, if the old man were laid up in prison, they could
very conveniently apply for his release in the proper quarter.&rdquo;
<a name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173">{173}</a></p>
<p>He saw men and places, and with his pen he created a land as distinct,
as wild, as vast, and as wonderful as the Spain of Cervantes.&nbsp;
He did this with no conscious preconceived design.&nbsp; His creation
was the effect of a multitude of impressions, all contributory because
all genuine and true to the depth of Borrow&rsquo;s own nature.&nbsp;
He had seen and felt Spain, and &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; shows
how; nor probably could he have shown it in any other way.&nbsp; Not
but what he could speak of Spain as the land of old renown, and of himself&mdash;in
a letter to the Bible Society in 1837&mdash;as an errant knight, and
of his servant Francisco as his squire.&nbsp; He did not see himself
as he was, or he would have seen both Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in
one, now riding a black Andalusian stallion, now driving an ass before
him.</p>
<p>Only a power as great as Borrow&rsquo;s own could show how this wild
Spain was built up.&nbsp; For it was not done by this and that, but
by a great man and a noble country in a state of accord continually
vibrating.</p>
<p>Thus he drew near to Finisterra with his wild Gallegan guide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a beautiful autumnal morning when we left the choza
and pursued our way to Corcuvion.&nbsp; I satisfied our host by presenting
him with a couple of pesetas; and he requested as a favour that if on
our return we passed that way, and were overtaken by the night, we would
again take up our abode beneath his roof.&nbsp; This I promised, at
the same time determining to do my best to guard against <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the
contingency, as sleeping in the loft of a Gallegan hut, though preferable
to passing the night on a moor or mountain, is anything but desirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we again started at a rapid pace along rough bridleways
and footpaths, amidst furze and brushwood.&nbsp; In about an hour we
obtained a view of the sea, and directed by a lad, whom we found on
the moor employed in tending a few miserable sheep, we bent our course
to the north-west, and at length reached the brow of an eminence, where
we stopped for some time to survey the prospect which opened before
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not without reason that the Latins gave the name of
Finisterr&aelig; to this district.&nbsp; We had arrived exactly at such
a place as in my boyhood I had pictured to myself as the termination
of the world, beyond which there was a wild sea, or abyss, or chaos.&nbsp;
I now saw far before me an immense ocean, and below me a long and irregular
line of lofty and precipitous coast.&nbsp; Certainly in the whole world
there is no bolder coast than the Gallegan shore, from the <i>d&eacute;bouchement</i>
of the Minho to Cape Finisterra.&nbsp; It consists of a granite wall
of savage mountains, for the most part serrated at the top, and occasionally
broken, where bays and firths like those of Vigo and Pontevedra intervene,
running deep into the land.&nbsp; These bays and firths are invariably
of an immense depth, and sufficiently capacious to shelter the navies
of the proudest maritime nations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an air of stern and savage grandeur in everything
around which strongly captivates the imagination.&nbsp; This savage
coast is the first glimpse of Spain which the voyager from the north
catches, or he who has ploughed his way across the wide Atlantic; and
well does it seem to realize all his visions of this strange land.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;this is indeed Spain&mdash;stern,
flinty Spain&mdash;land emblematic of those spirits to which she has
given birth.&nbsp; From what land but that before me could have proceeded
<!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>those
portentous beings who astounded the Old World and filled the New with
horror and blood&mdash;Alba and Philip, Cortez and Pizarro&mdash;stern
colossal spectres looming through the gloom of bygone years, like yonder
granite mountains through the haze, upon the eye of the mariner?&nbsp;
Yes, yonder is indeed Spain&mdash;flinty, indomitable Spain&mdash;land
emblematic of its sons!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for myself, when I viewed that wide ocean and its savage
shore, I cried, &lsquo;Such is the grave, and such are its terrific
sides; those moors and wilds over which I have passed are the rough
and dreary journey of life.&nbsp; Cheered with hope, we struggle along
through all the difficulties of moor, bog, and mountain, to arrive at&mdash;what?&nbsp;
The grave and its dreary sides.&nbsp; Oh, may hope not desert us in
the last hour&mdash;hope in the Redeemer and in God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We descended from the eminence, and again lost sight of the
sea amidst ravines and dingles, amongst which patches of pine were occasionally
seen.&nbsp; Continuing to descend, we at last came, not to the sea,
but to the extremity of a long, narrow firth, where stood a village
or hamlet; whilst at a small distance, on the western side of the firth,
appeared one considerably larger, which was indeed almost entitled to
the appellation of town.&nbsp; This last was Corcuvion; the first, if
I forget not, was called Ria de Silla.&nbsp; We hastened on to Corcuvion,
where I bade my guide make inquiries respecting Finisterra.&nbsp; He
entered the door of a wine-house, from which proceeded much noise and
vociferation, and presently returned, informing me that the village
of Finisterra was distant about a league and a half.&nbsp; A man, evidently
in a state of intoxication, followed him to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are
you bound for Finisterra, cavalheiros?&rsquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, my friend,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;we are going
thither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then you are going amongst a flock of drunkards&rsquo;
<!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>(<i>fato
de borrachos</i>), he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take care that they do
not play you a trick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed on, and striking across a sandy peninsula at the
back of the town, soon reached the shore of an immense bay, the north-westernmost
end of which was formed by the far-famed cape of Finisterra, which we
now saw before us stretching far into the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along the beach of dazzling white sand we advanced towards
the cape, the bourne of our journey.&nbsp; The sun was shining brightly,
and every object was illumined by his beams.&nbsp; The sea lay before
us like a vast mirror, and the waves which broke upon the shore were
so tiny as scarcely to produce a murmur.&nbsp; On we sped along the
deep winding bay, overhung by gigantic hills and mountains.&nbsp; Strange
recollections began to throng upon my mind.&nbsp; It was upon this beach
that, according to the tradition of all ancient Christendom, St. James,
the patron saint of Spain, preached the gospel to the heathen Spaniards.&nbsp;
Upon this beach had once stood an immense commercial city, the proudest
in all Spain.&nbsp; This now desolate bay had once resounded with the
voices of myriads, when the keels and commerce of all the then known
world were wafted to Duyo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the name of this village?&rsquo; said I to
a woman, as we passed by five or six ruinous houses at the bend of the
bay, ere we entered upon the peninsula of Finisterra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is no village,&rsquo; said the Gallegan&mdash;&lsquo;this
is no village, Sir Cavalier; this is a city&mdash;this is Duyo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for the glory of the world!&nbsp; These huts were
all that the roaring sea and the tooth of time had left of Duyo, the
great city!&nbsp; Onward now to Finisterra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spends little time on such declamatory description, but it is
essential to the whole effect.&nbsp; This particular piece is followed
by the difficulty of a long ascent, by a sleep of exhaustion on a rude
and dirty bed, by Borrow&rsquo;s arrest as the Pretender, Don Carlos,
in disguise, by an escape from <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>immediate
execution into the hands of an Alcalde who read &ldquo;Jeremy Bentham&rdquo;
day and night; all this in one short chapter.</p>
<p>Equally essential is the type of landscape represented by the solitary
ruined fort in the monotonous waste between Estremoz and Elvas, which
he climbed to over stones that cut his feet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being about to leave the place, I heard a strange cry behind
a part of the wall which I had not visited; and hastening thither, I
found a miserable object in rags seated upon a stone.&nbsp; It was a
maniac&mdash;a man about thirty years of age, and I believe deaf and
dumb.&nbsp; There he sat, gibbering and mowing, and distorting his wild
features into various dreadful appearances.&nbsp; There wanted nothing
but this object to render the scene complete; banditti amongst such
melancholy desolation would have been by no means so much in keeping.&nbsp;
But the manaic on his stone, in the rear of the wind-beaten ruin overlooking
the blasted heath, above which scowled the leaden heaven, presented
such a picture of gloom and misery as I believe neither painter nor
poet ever conceived in the saddest of their musings.&nbsp; This is not
the first instance in which it has been my lot to verify the wisdom
of the saying that truth is sometimes wilder than fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Oropesa he heard from the barber-surgeon of the mysterious Guadarrama
mountains, and of the valley that lay undiscovered and unknown for thousands
of years until a hunter found there a tribe of people speaking a language
unknown to anyone else and ignorant of the rest of men.&nbsp; Rough
wild ways intersect the book.&nbsp; Thunder storms overhang it.&nbsp;
Immense caverns echo beneath it.&nbsp; The travellers left behind a
mill which &ldquo;stood at the bottom of a valley shaded by large trees,
and its wheels were turning with a dismal and monotonous noise,&rdquo;
and they emerged, by the light of &ldquo;a corner of the moon,&rdquo;
on <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>to
the wildest heath of the wildest province of Spain, ignorant of their
way, making for a place which the guide believed not to exist.&nbsp;
They passed a defile where the carrier had been attacked on his last
journey by robbers, who burnt the coach by means of the letters in it,
and butchered all except the carrier, who had formerly been the master
of one of the gang: as they passed, the ground was still saturated with
the blood of one of the murdered soldiers and a dog was gnawing a piece
of his skull.&nbsp; Borrow was told of an old viper catcher caught by
the robbers, who plundered and stripped him and then tied his hands
behind him and thrust his head into his sack, &ldquo;which contained
several of these horrible reptiles alive,&rdquo; and so he ran mad through
the villages until he fell dead.&nbsp; As a background, he had again
and again a scene like that one, whose wild waters and mountains, and
the &ldquo;Convent of the Precipices&rdquo; standing out against the
summit, reminded him at once of Salvator Rosa and of Stolberg&rsquo;s
lines to a mountain torrent: &ldquo;The pine trees are shaken. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
Describing the cave at Gibraltar, he spoke of it as always having been
&ldquo;a den for foul night birds, reptiles, and beasts of prey,&rdquo;
of precipice after precipice, abyss after abyss, in apparently endless
succession, and of an explorer who perished there and lay &ldquo;even
now rotting in the bowels of the mountain, preyed upon by its blind
and noisome worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he saw a peaceful rich landscape in a bright sunny hour, as
at Monte Moro, he shed tears of rapture, sitting on and on in those
reveries which, as he well knew, only enervate the mind: or he felt
that he would have desired &ldquo;no better fate than that of a shepherd
on the prairies or a hunter on the hills of Bembibre&rdquo;: or looking
through an iron-grated door at a garden court in Seville he sighed that
his fate did not permit him to reside in such an Eden for the remainder
of his days.&nbsp; For as he delights in the <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>dismal,
grand, or wild, so he does with equal intensity in the sweetness of
loveliness, as in the country about Seville: &ldquo;Oh how pleasant
it is, especially in springtide, to stray along the shores of the Guadalquivir!&nbsp;
Not far from the city, down the river, lies a grove called Las Delicias,
or the Delights.&nbsp; It consists of trees of various kinds, but more
especially of poplars and elms, and is traversed by long, shady walks.&nbsp;
This grove is the favourite promenade of the Sevillians, and there one
occasionally sees assembled whatever the town produces of beauty or
gallantry.&nbsp; There wander the black-eyed Andalusian dames and damsels,
clad in their graceful silken mantillas; and there gallops the Andalusian
cavalier on his long-tailed, thick-maned steed of Moorish ancestry.&nbsp;
As the sun is descending, it is enchanting to glance back from this
place in the direction of the city; the prospect is inexpressibly beautiful.&nbsp;
Yonder in the distance, high and enormous, stands the Golden Tower,
now used as a toll-house, but the principal bulwark of the city in the
time of the Moors.&nbsp; It stands on the shore of the river, like a
giant keeping watch, and is the first edifice which attracts the eye
of the voyager as he moves up the stream to Seville.&nbsp; On the other
side, opposite the tower, stands the noble Augustine Convent, the ornament
of the faubourg of Triana; whilst between the two edifices rolls the
broad Guadalquivir, bearing on its bosom a flotilla of barks from Catalonia
and Valencia.&nbsp; Farther up is seen the bridge of boats which traverses
the water.&nbsp; The principal object of this prospect, however, is
the Golden Tower, where the beams of the setting sun seem to be concentrated
as in the focus, so that it appears built of pure gold, and probably
from that circumstance received the name which it now bears.&nbsp; Cold,
cold must the heart be which can remain insensible to the beauties of
this magic scene, to do justice to which the pencil of Claude himself
were barely equal.&nbsp; Often have I shed tears of rapture <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>whilst
I beheld it, and listened to the thrush and the nightingale piping forth
their melodious songs in the woods, and inhaled the breeze laden with
the perfume of the thousand orange gardens of Seville.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Kennst du das land wo die citronen bluhen?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a scene was not in fact superlative his creative memory would
furnish it with what it lacked, giving the cathedral of Palencia, for
example, windows painted by Murillo.</p>
<h2><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>CHAPTER
XXI&mdash;&ldquo;THE BIBLE IN SPAIN&rdquo;: THE CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>In such scenes, naturally, Borrow placed nothing common and nothing
mean.&nbsp; He must have a madman among the ruins, or by a pool a peasant
woman sitting, who has been mad ever since her child was drowned there,
or a mule and a stallion fighting with hoofs and teeth.&nbsp; The clergy,
in their ugly shovel hats and long cloaks, glared at him askance as
he passed by their whispering groups in Salamanca: at the English College
in Valladolid, he thought of &ldquo;those pale, smiling, half-foreign
priests who, like stealthy grimalkins, traversed green England in all
directions&rdquo; under the persecution of Elizabeth.&nbsp; If he painted
an archbishop plainly dressed in black cassock and silken cap, stooping,
feeble, pale and emaciated, he set upon his finger a superb amethyst
of a dazzling lustre&mdash;Borrow never saw a finer, except one belonging
to an acquaintance of his own, a Tartar Khan.</p>
<p>The day after his interview with the archbishop he had a visit from
Benedict Mol.&nbsp; This man is proved to have existed by a letter from
Rey Romero to Borrow mentioning &ldquo;The German of the Treasure.&rdquo;
<a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181">{181}</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;True,
every word of it!&rdquo; says Knapp: &ldquo;Remember our artist never
created; he painted from models.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because he existed, therefore
every word of Borrow&rsquo;s concerning him is true.&nbsp; As Borrow
made him, &ldquo;He is a bulky old man, somewhat above the middle height,
and with white hair and ruddy features; his eyes were large and blue,
and, whenever he fixed them <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>on
anyone&rsquo;s countenance, were full of an expression of great eagerness,
as if he were expecting the communication of some important tidings.&nbsp;
He was dressed commonly enough, in a jacket and trousers of coarse cloth
of a russet colour; on his head was an immense sombrero, the brim of
which had been much cut and mutilated, so as in some places to resemble
the jags or denticles of a saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus, at Madrid in 1836, he told his story on the first meeting,
as men had to do when they were interrogated by Borrow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my asking him who he was, the following conversation
ensued between us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a Swiss of Lucerne, Benedict Mol by name, once
a soldier in the Walloon Guard, and now a soap-boiler, <i>para servir
usted</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You speak the language of Spain very imperfectly,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;how long have you been in the country?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forty-five years,&rsquo; replied Benedict.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
when the guard was broken up I went to Minorca, where I lost the Spanish
language without acquiring the Catalan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have been a soldier of the King of Spain,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;how did you like the service?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so well but that I should have been glad to leave
it forty years ago; the pay was bad, and the treatment worse.&nbsp;
I will now speak Swiss to you; for, if I am not much mistaken, you are
a German man, and understand the speech of Lucerne.&nbsp; I should soon
have deserted from the service of Spain, as I did from that of the Pope,
whose soldier I was in my early youth before I came here; but I had
married a woman of Minorca, by whom I had two children: it was this
that detained me in these parts so long.&nbsp; Before, however, I left
Minorca, my wife died; and as for my children, one went east, the other
west, and I know not what became of them.&nbsp; I intend shortly to
return to Lucerne, and live there like a duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have
you then realized a large capital in Spain?&rsquo; said I, glancing
at his hat and the rest of his apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not a cuart, not a cuart; these two wash-balls are
all that I possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps you are the son of good parents, and have lands
and money in your own country wherewith to support yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not a heller, not a heller.&nbsp; My father was hangman
of Lucerne, and when he died, his body was seized to pay his debts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then doubtless,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you intend to
ply your trade of soap-boiling at Lucerne.&nbsp; You are quite right,
my friend; I know of no occupation more honourable or useful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have no thoughts of plying my trade at Lucerne,&rsquo;
replied Benedict.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now, as I see you are a German man,
Lieber Herr, and as I like your countenance and your manner of speaking,
I will tell you in confidence that I know very little of my trade, and
have already been turned out of several fabriques as an evil workman;
the two wash-balls that I carry in my pocket are not of my own making.&nbsp;
<i>In kurtzen</i>, I know little more of soap-boiling than I do of tailoring,
horse-farriery, or shoe-making, all of which I have practised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I know not how you can hope to live like a hertzog
in your native canton, unless you expect that the men of Lucerne, in
consideration of your services to the Pope and to the King of Spain,
will maintain you in splendour at the public expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lieber Herr,&rsquo; said Benedict, &lsquo;the men of
Lucerne are by no means fond of maintaining the soldiers of the Pope
and the King of Spain at their own expense; many of the guard who have
returned thither beg their bread in the streets: but when I go, it shall
be in a coach drawn by six mules with a treasure, a mighty schatz which
lies in the church of St. James of Compostella, in Galicia.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I
hope you do not intend to rob the church,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you do, however, I believe you will be disappointed.&nbsp; Mendizabal
and the Liberals have been beforehand with you.&nbsp; I am informed
that at present no other treasure is to be found in the cathedrals of
Spain than a few paltry ornaments and plated utensils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My good German Herr,&rsquo; said Benedict, &lsquo;it
is no church schatz; and no person living, save myself, knows of its
existence.&nbsp; Nearly thirty years ago, amongst the sick soldiers
who were brought to Madrid, was one of my comrades of the Walloon Guard,
who had accompanied the French to Portugal; he was very sick, and shortly
died.&nbsp; Before, however, he breathed his last, he sent for me, and
upon his death-bed told me that himself and two other soldiers, both
of whom had since been killed, had buried in a certain church in Compostella
a great booty which they had made in Portugal; it consisted of gold
moidores and of a packet of huge diamonds from the Brazils: the whole
was contained in a large copper kettle.&nbsp; I listened with greedy
ears, and from that moment, I may say, I have known no rest, neither
by day nor night, thinking of the schatz.&nbsp; It is very easy to find,
for the dying man was so exact in his description of the place where
it lies, that were I once at Compostella I should have no difficulty
in putting my hand upon it.&nbsp; Several times I have been on the point
of setting out on the journey, but something has always happened to
stop me.&nbsp; When my wife died, I left Minorca with a determination
to go to St. James; but on reaching Madrid, I fell into the hands of
a Basque woman, who persuaded me to live with her, which I have done
for several years.&nbsp; She is a great hax, <a name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184">{184}</a>
and says that if I desert her she will breathe a spell which shall cling
to me for ever.&nbsp; <i>Dem Got sey dank</i>, she is now in the hospital,
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and
daily expected to die.&nbsp; This is my history, Lieber Herr.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notice that Borrow continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been the more careful in relating the above conversation,
as I shall have frequent occasion to mention the Swiss in the course
of these journals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benedict Mol had the faculty of re-appearance.&nbsp; In the next
year at Compostella the moonlight fell on his grey locks and weatherbeaten
face and Borrow recognised him.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Och</i>,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;<i>mein Gott</i>, <i>es ist der Herr</i>!&rdquo; (it
is that gentleman).&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, what good fortune, that the <i>Herr</i>
is the first person I meet in Compostella.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Borrow
could scarcely believe his eyes.&nbsp; Benedict had come to dig for
the treasure, and in the meantime proposed to live at the best hotel
and pay his score when the digging was done.&nbsp; Borrow gave him a
dollar, which he paid to a witch for telling him where exactly the treasure
lay.&nbsp; A third time, to his own satisfaction and Borrow&rsquo;s
astonishment, he re-appeared at Oviedo.&nbsp; He had, in fact, followed
Borrow to Corunna, having been despitefully used at Compostella, met
highwaymen on the road, and suffered hunger so that he slaughtered a
stray kid and devoured it raw.&nbsp; From Oviedo he trod in Borrow&rsquo;s
footsteps, which was &ldquo;a great comfort in his horrible journeys.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A strange life has he led,&rdquo; said Borrow&rsquo;s Greek servant,
&ldquo;and a strange death he will die&mdash;it is written on his countenance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He re-appeared a fourth time at Madrid, in light green coat and pantaloons
that were almost new, and a glossy Andalusian hat &ldquo;of immense
altitude of cone,&rdquo; and leaning not on a ragged staff but &ldquo;a
huge bamboo rattan, surmounted by the grim head of either a bear or
lion, curiously cut out of pewter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been wandering
after Borrow in misery that almost sent him mad:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the horror of wandering about the savage hills and wide
plains of Spain without money and without hope!&nbsp; <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Sometimes
I became desperate, when I found myself amongst rocks and barrancos,
perhaps after having tasted no food from sunrise to sunset, and then
I would raise my staff towards the sky and shake it, crying, Lieber
herr Gott, ach lieber herr Gott, you must help me now or never.&nbsp;
If you tarry, I am lost.&nbsp; You must help me now, now!&nbsp; And
once when I was raving in this manner, methought I heard a voice&mdash;nay,
I am sure I heard it&mdash;sounding from the hollow of a rock, clear
and strong; and it cried, &lsquo;Der schatz, der schatz, it is not yet
dug up.&nbsp; To Madrid, to Madrid!&nbsp; The way to the schatz is through
Madrid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now he had met people who supported him with an eye to the treasure.&nbsp;
Borrow tried to persuade him to circulate the Gospel instead of risking
failure and the anger of his clients.&nbsp; Luckily Benedict went on
to Compostella:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went, and I never saw him more.&nbsp; What I heard, however,
was extraordinary enough.&nbsp; It appeared that the government had
listened to his tale, and had been so struck with Benedict&rsquo;s exaggerated
description of the buried treasure, that they imagined that, by a little
trouble and outlay, gold and diamonds might be dug up at St. James sufficient
to enrich themselves and to pay off the national debt of Spain.&nbsp;
The Swiss returned to Compostella &lsquo;like a duke,&rsquo; to use
his own words.&nbsp; The affair, which had at first been kept a profound
secret, was speedily divulged.&nbsp; It was, indeed, resolved that the
investigation, which involved consequences of so much importance, should
take place in a manner the most public and imposing.&nbsp; A solemn
festival was drawing nigh, and it was deemed expedient that the search
should take place upon that day.&nbsp; The day arrived.&nbsp; All the
bells in Compostella pealed.&nbsp; The whole populace thronged from
their houses; a thousand troops were drawn up in a square; the expectation
of all was wound up to the highest pitch.&nbsp; A procession directed
its course to the church of San Roque.&nbsp; At its head were <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>the
captain-general and the Swiss, brandishing in his hand the magic rattan;
close behind walked the <i>meiga</i>, the Gallegan witch-wife, by whom
the treasure-seeker had been originally guided in the search; numerous
masons brought up the rear, bearing implements to break up the ground.&nbsp;
The procession enters the church; they pass through it in solemn march;
they find themselves in a vaulted passage.&nbsp; The Swiss looks around.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dig here,&rsquo; said he suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, dig here,&rsquo;
said the meiga.&nbsp; The masons labour; the floor is broken up&mdash;a
horrible and fetid odour arises. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, no treasure was found, and my warning to the unfortunate
Swiss turned out but too prophetic.&nbsp; He was forthwith seized and
flung into the horrid prison of St. James, amidst the execrations of
thousands, who would have gladly torn him limb from limb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair did not terminate here.&nbsp; The political opponents
of the government did not allow so favourable an opportunity to escape
for launching the shafts of ridicule.&nbsp; The Moderados were taunted
in the cortes for their avarice and credulity, whilst the Liberal press
wafted on its wings through Spain the story of the treasure-hunt at
St. James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After all, it was a <i>trampa</i> <a name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187">{187}</a>
of Don Jorge&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said one of my enemies.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
fellow is at the bottom of half the picardias which happen in Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eager to learn the fate of the Swiss, I wrote to my old friend
Rey Romero, at Compostella.&nbsp; In his answer he states: &lsquo;I
saw the Swiss in prison, to which place he sent for me, craving my assistance,
for the sake of the friendship which I bore to you.&nbsp; But how could
I help him?&nbsp; He was speedily after removed from St. James, I know
not whither.&nbsp; It is said that he disappeared on the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.&nbsp; Where in the
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>whole
cycle of romance shall we find anything more wild, grotesque, and sad
than the easily authenticated history of Benedict Mol, the treasure-digger
of St. James?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knapp, by the way, prints this very letter from Rey Romero.&nbsp;
It was his son who saw Benedict in prison, and he simply says that he
does not know what has become of him.</p>
<p>As Dr. Knapp says, Borrow painted from a model.&nbsp; That is to
say, he did like everybody else.&nbsp; Of course he did not invent.&nbsp;
Why should a man with such a life invent for the purpose of only five
books?&nbsp; But there is no such thing as invention (in the popular
sense), except in the making of <i>bad</i> nonsense rhymes or novels.&nbsp;
A writer composes out of his experience, inward, outward and histrionic,
or along the protracted lines of his experience.&nbsp; Borrow felt that
adventures and unusual scenes were his due, and when they were not forthcoming
he revived an old one or revised the present in the weird light of the
past.&nbsp; Is this invention?</p>
<p>Pictures like that of Benedict Mol are not made out of nothing by
Borrow or anybody else.&nbsp; Nor are they copies.&nbsp; The man who
could merely copy nature would never have the eyes to see such beauties
as Benedict Mol.&nbsp; It must be noticed how effective is the re-appearance,
the intermingling of such a man with &ldquo;ordinary life,&rdquo; and
then finally the suggestion of one of Borrow&rsquo;s enemies that he
was put up to it by <i>Don Jorge</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That fellow is at
the bottom of half the <i>picardias</i> which happen in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What glory for <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; The story would have been entertaining
enough as a mere isolated short story: thus scattered, it is twice as
effective as if it were a mere fiction, whether labelled &ldquo;a true
story&rdquo; or introduced by an ingenious variation of the same.&nbsp;
It is one of Borrow&rsquo;s triumphs never to let us escape from the
spell of actuality into a languid acquiescence in what is &ldquo;only
pretending.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>form
never becomes a fiction, even to the same extent as that of Turgenev&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sportsman&rsquo;s Sketches&rdquo;; for Borrow is always faithful
to the form of a book of travel in Spain during the &rsquo;thirties.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; the lesser
narratives are as a rule introduced without much attempt at probability,
but as mere diversions.&nbsp; They are never such in &ldquo;The Bible
in Spain,&rdquo; though they are in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gypsy hag of Badajoz, who proposed to poison
all the <i>Busn&eacute;</i> in Madrid, and then away with the London
Caloro to the land of the Moor&mdash;his Greek servant Antonio, even
though he begins with &ldquo;Je vais vous raconter mon histoire du commencement
jusqu&rsquo;i&ccedil;i.&rdquo;&mdash;the Italian whom he had met as
a boy and who now regretted leaving England, the toasted cheese and
bread, the Suffolk ale, the roaring song and merry jests of the labourers,&mdash;and
Antonio again, telling him &ldquo;the history of the young man of the
inn,&rdquo;&mdash;these story-tellers are not merely consummate variations
upon those of the &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gil Blas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The book never ceases to be a book of travel by an agent of the Bible
Society.&nbsp; It is to its very great advantage that it was not written
all of a piece with one conscious aim.&nbsp; The roughness, the merely
accurate irrelevant detail here and there, the mention of his journal,
and the references to well-known and substantial people, win from us
an openness and simplicity of reception which ensure a success for it
beyond that of most fictions.&nbsp; I cannot refuse complete belief
in the gigantic Jew, Abarbanel, for example, when Borrow has said: &ldquo;I
had now a full view of his face and figure, and those huge featured
and Herculean form still occasionally revisit me in my dreams.&nbsp;
I see him standing in the moonshine, staring me in the face with his
deep calm eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not feel bound to believe that he
had met the Italian of Corunna twenty years before at Norwich, though
to a man with his memory for faces such re-appearances are <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>likely
to happen many times as often as to an ordinary man.&nbsp; But I feel
no doubt about Judah Lib, who spoke to him at Gibraltar: he was &ldquo;about
to exclaim, &lsquo;I know you not,&rsquo; when one or two lineaments
struck him, and he cried, though somewhat hesitatingly, &lsquo;surely
this is Judah Lib.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues: &ldquo;It was in
a steamer in the Baltic in the year &rsquo;34, if I mistake not.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That he had this strong memory is certain; but that he knew it, and
was proud of it, and likely to exaggerate it, is almost equally certain.</p>
<p>It was natural that such a knight should have squires of high degree,
as Francisco the Basque and the two Antonios, Gypsy and Greek.&nbsp;
Antonio the Greek left Borrow to serve a count as cook, but the count
attacked him with a rapier, whereupon he gave notice in the following
manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly I took a large casserole from the fire in which various
eggs were frying; this I held out at arm&rsquo;s length, peering at
it along my arm as if I were curiously inspecting it&mdash;my right
foot advanced, and the other thrown back as far as possible.&nbsp; All
stood still, imagining, doubtless, that I was about to perform some
grand operation; and so I was: for suddenly the sinister leg advancing,
with one rapid <i>coup de pied</i> I sent the casserole and its contents
flying over my head, so that they struck the wall far behind me.&nbsp;
This was to let them know that I had broken my staff and had shaken
the dust off my feet.&nbsp; So casting upon the count the peculiar glance
of the Sceirote cooks when they feel themselves insulted, and extending
my mouth on either side nearly as far as the ears, I took down my haversack
and departed, singing as I went the song of the ancient Demos, who,
when dying, asked for his supper, and water wherewith to lave his hands:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&Omicron; &eta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&epsilon;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;, &kappa;&iota;
&omicron; &Delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &delta;&iota;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&zeta;&epsilon;&iota;.
<br />
&Sigma;&upsilon;&rho;&tau;&epsilon;, &pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&iota;&alpha;,
&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;, &rsquo;&sigma; &tau;&omicron; &nu;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;
&psi;&omega;&mu;&iota; &nu;&alpha; &phi;&alpha;&tau;' &alpha;&pi;&omicron;&psi;&epsilon;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in this manner, mon ma&icirc;tre, I left the house of the Count
of ---.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The
morning after Francisco died, when Borrow was lying in bed ruminating
on his loss, he heard someone cleaning boots and singing in an unknown
tongue, so he rang the bell.&nbsp; Antonio appeared.&nbsp; He had, he
said, engaged himself to the Prime Minister at a high salary, but on
hearing of Borrow&rsquo;s loss, he &ldquo;told the Duke, though it was
late at night, that he would not suit me; and here I am.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again he left Borrow.&nbsp; When he returned it was in obedience to
a dream, in which he saw his master ride on a black horse up to his
inn&mdash;yet this was immediately after Borrow&rsquo;s landing on his
third visit to Spain, of which &ldquo;only two individuals in Madrid
were aware.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Greek was acquainted with all the cutthroats
in Galicia; he could tell a story like Sterne, and in every way was
a servant who deserved no less a master than <i>Monsieur Georges</i>.</p>
<p>Francisco has already sufficiently adorned these pages.&nbsp; As
for the other Antonio, the Gypsy, he guided Borrow through the worst
of Spain on his way to Madrid.&nbsp; This he offered to do in such terms
that Borrow&rsquo;s hint at the possible danger of accepting it falls
flat.&nbsp; He was as mysterious as Borrow himself, and being asked
why he was taking this particular road, he answered: &ldquo;It is an
affair of Egypt, brother, and I shall not acquaint you with it; peradventure
it relates to a horse or an ass, or peradventure it relates to a mule
or a <i>macho</i>; it does not relate to yourself, therefore I advise
you not to inquire about it&mdash;<i>Dosta</i>. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He
carried a loadstone in his bosom and swallowed some of the dust of it,
and it served both for passport and for prayers.&nbsp; When he had to
leave Borrow he sold him a savage and vicious she ass, recommending
her for the same reason as he bought her, because &ldquo;a savage and
vicious beast has generally four excellent legs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>CHAPTER
XXII&mdash;&ldquo;THE BIBLE IN SPAIN&rdquo;: STYLE</h2>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s Spanish portrait of himself was worthy of its background.&nbsp;
Much was required of him in a world where a high fantastical acrobatic
mountebankery was almost a matter of ceremony, where riders stand on
their heads in passing their rivals and cooks punt a casserole over
their heads to the wall behind by way of giving notice: much was required
of him and he proved worthy.&nbsp; He saw himself, I suppose, as a great
imaginative master of fiction sees a hero.&nbsp; His attitude cannot
be called vanity: it is too consistent and continuous and its effect
by far too powerful.&nbsp; He puts his own name into the speeches of
other men in a manner that is very rare: he does not start at the sound
of <i>Don Jorge</i>.&nbsp; He said to the silent archbishop: &ldquo;I
suppose your lordship knows who I am? . . . I am he whom the <i>Manolos</i>
of Madrid call <i>Don Jorgito el Ingles</i>; I am just come out of prison,
whither I was sent for circulating my Lord&rsquo;s Gospel in this Kingdom
of Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He allows the archbishop to put this celebrity
on horseback: &ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>! how you ride!&nbsp; It is dangerous
to be in your way.&rdquo;&nbsp; His horses are magnificent: &ldquo;What,&rdquo;
he asks, &ldquo;what is a missionary in the heart of Spain without a
horse?&nbsp; Which consideration induced me now to purchase an Arabian
of high caste, which had been brought from Algiers by an officer of
the French legion.&nbsp; The name of this steed, the best I believe
that ever issued from the desert, was Sidi Habismilk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can forget Quesada and his two friends lording it on horseback
over the crowd, and Borrow shouting &ldquo;<i>Viva</i> <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span><i>Quesada</i>,&rdquo;
or forget the old Moor of Tangier talking of horses?&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good are the horses of the Moslems,&rsquo; said my
old friend; &lsquo;where will you find such?&nbsp; They will descend
rocky mountains at full speed and neither trip nor fall; but you must
be cautious with the horses of the Moslems, and treat them with kindness,
for the horses of the Moslems are proud, and they like not being slaves.&nbsp;
When they are young and first mounted, jerk not their mouths with your
bit, for be sure if you do they will kill you&mdash;sooner or later
you will perish beneath their feet.&nbsp; Good are our horses, and good
our riders&mdash;yea, very good are the Moslems at mounting the horse;
who are like them?&nbsp; I once saw a Frank rider compete with a Moslem
on this beach, and at first the Frank rider had it all his own way,
and he passed the Moslem.&nbsp; But the course was long, very long,
and the horse of the Frank rider, which was a Frank also, panted; but
the horse of the Moslem panted not, for he was a Moslem also, and the
Moslem rider at last gave a cry, and the horse sprang forward, and he
overtook the Frank horse, and then the Moslem rider stood up in his
saddle.&nbsp; How did he stand?&nbsp; Truly he stood on his head, and
these eyes saw him.&nbsp; He stood on his head in the saddle as he passed
the Frank rider, and he cried, Ha, ha! as he passed the Frank rider;
and the Moslem horse cried, Ha, ha! as he passed the Frank breed, and
the Frank lost by a far distance.&nbsp; Good are the Franks, good their
horses; but better are the Moslems, and better the horses of the Moslems.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that he used to ride his black Andalusian horse in Madrid
with a Russian skin for a saddle and without stirrups.&nbsp; He had,
he says, been accustomed from childhood to ride without a saddle.&nbsp;
Yet Borrow could do without a horse.&nbsp; He never fails to make himself
impressive.&nbsp; He stoops to his knee to scare a huge and ferocious
dog <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>by
looking him full in the eyes.&nbsp; The spies, as he sat waiting for
the magistrate at Madrid, whisper, &ldquo;He understands the seven Gypsy
jargons,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He can ride a horse and dart a knife full
as well as if he came from my own country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain
of the ship tells a friend in a low voice, overheard by Borrow: &ldquo;That
fellow who is lying on the deck can speak Christian, too, when it serves
his purpose; but he speaks others which are by no means Christian.&nbsp;
He can talk English, and I myself have heard him chatter in Gitano with
the Gypsies of Triana.&nbsp; He is now going amongst the Moors; and
when he arrives in their country, you will hear him, should you be there,
converse as fluently in their gibberish as in Christiano&mdash;nay,
better, for he is no Christian himself.&nbsp; He has been several times
on board my vessel already; but I do not like him, as I consider that
he carries something about with him which is not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American at Tangier is perplexed by his speaking both Moorish
and Gaelic, by hearing from an Irish woman that he is &ldquo;a fairy
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does not confine himself to the mysterious sublime.&nbsp; He tells
us, for example, that Mendizabal, the Prime Minister, was a huge athletic
man, &ldquo;somewhat taller than myself, who measure six-feet-two without
my shoes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several times he was mistaken for a Jew, and
once for a Rabbi, by the Jews themselves.&nbsp; Add to this the expression
that he put on for the benefit of the farrier at Betanzos: he was stooping
to close the vein that had been opened in the leg of his horse, and
he &ldquo;looked up into the farrier&rsquo;s face, arching his eyebrows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Carracho</i>! what an evil wizard!&rsquo; muttered the farrier,
as he walked away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="picture">
<a href="images/page194.jpg">
<img alt="Mendizabal, The Spanish Minister" src="images/page194.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the wilds he grew a beard&mdash;he had one at Jaraicejo&mdash;and
it is perhaps worth noticing this, to rebut the opinion that he could
not grow a beard, and that he was therefore as other men are with the
same disability.&nbsp; He speaks more <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>than
once of his shedding tears, and at Lisbon he kissed the stone above
Fielding&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; But these are little things of little
importance in the landscape portrait which emerges from the whole of
the book, of the grave adventurer, all but always equal in his boldness
and his discretion, the lord of those wild ways and wild men, who &ldquo;rides
in the whirlwind and directs the storm&rdquo; all over Spain.</p>
<p>In brief, he is the very hero that a wondering and waiting audience
would be satisfied to see appearing upon such a stage.&nbsp; Except
Dante on his background of Heaven and Hell, and Byron on his background
of Europe and Time, no writer had in one book placed himself with greater
distinction before the world.&nbsp; His glory was threefold.&nbsp; He
was the man who was a Gypsy in politics, because he had lived with Gypsies
so long.&nbsp; He was the man who said to the Spanish Prime Minister:
&ldquo;It is a pleasant thing to be persecuted for the Gospel&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the man of whom it was said <i>by an enemy</i>,
after the affair of Benedict Mol, that <i>Don Jorge</i> was at the bottom
of half the knavish farces in Spain.</p>
<p>Very little of Borrow&rsquo;s effectiveness can seriously be attributed
to this or that quality of style, for it will all amount to saying that
he had an effective style.&nbsp; But it may be permissible to point
out that it is also a style that is unnoticeable except for what it
effects.&nbsp; It runs at times to rotten Victorianism, both heavy and
vague, as when he calls <i>El Greco</i> or Domenico &ldquo;a most extraordinary
genius, some of whose productions possess merit of a very high order.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He is capable of calling the eye the &ldquo;orb of vision,&rdquo; and
the moon &ldquo;the beauteous luminary.&rdquo;&nbsp; I quote a passage
lest it should seem incredible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon had arisen when we mounted our horses to return to
the village, and the rays of the beauteous luminary danced merrily on
the rushing waters of the Tagus, silvered the plain over which we were
passing, and bathed in a flood <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>of
brightness the bold sides of the calcareous hill of Villaluengo, the
antique ruins which crowned its brow. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Description, taking him away from men and from his active self, often
lured him into this kind of thing.&nbsp; And, nevertheless, such is
Borrow that I should by no means employ a gentleman of refinement to
go over &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; and cross out the like.&nbsp;
It all helps in the total of half theatrical and wholly wild exuberance
and robustness.&nbsp; Another minute contributory element of style is
the Biblical phrasing.&nbsp; His home and certainly his work for the
Society had made him familiar with the Bible.&nbsp; He quotes it several
times in passages which bring him into comparison, if not equality,
with Jesus and with Paul.&nbsp; A little after quoting, &ldquo;Ride
on, because of the word of righteousness,&rdquo; he writes: &ldquo;I
repaired to the aqueduct, and sat down beneath the hundred and seventh
arch, where I waited the greater part of the day, <i>but he came not</i>,
<i>whereupon I arose and went into the city</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
fond of &ldquo;even,&rdquo; saying, for example, or making Judah Lib
say, &ldquo;He bent his way unto the East, <i>even to Jerusalem</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The &ldquo;beauteous luminary&rdquo; vein and the Biblical vein may
be said to be inseparable from the long cloak, the sombrero, the picturesque
romance and mystery of Spain, as they appeared to one for whom romance
and mystery alike were never without pomp.&nbsp; But with all his rant
he is invariably substantial, never aerial, and he chequers it in a
Byronic manner with a sudden prose reference to bugs, or a question,
or a piece of dialogue.</p>
<p>His dialogue can hardly be over-praised.&nbsp; It is life-like in
its effect, though not in its actual phrases, and it breaks up the narrative
and description over and over again at the right time.&nbsp; What he
puts into the mouth of shepherds with whom he sits round the fire is
more than twice as potent as if it were in his own narrative; he varies
the point of view, and yet always without allowing himself to <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>disappear
from the scene&mdash;he, the <i>se&ntilde;or</i> traveller.&nbsp; These
spoken words are, it is true, in Borrow&rsquo;s own style, with little
or no colloquialism, but they are simpler.&nbsp; They also, in their
turn, are broken up by words or phrases from the language of the speaker.&nbsp;
The effect of this must vary with the reader.&nbsp; The learned will
not pause, some of the unlearned will be impatient.&nbsp; But as a glossary
was afterwards granted at Ford&rsquo;s suggestion, and is now to be
had in the cheapest editions of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; these
few hundred Spanish or Gypsy words are at least no serious stumbling
block.&nbsp; I find them a very distinct additional flavour in the style.&nbsp;
A good writer can afford these mysteries.&nbsp; Children do not boggle
at the unpronounceable names of a good book like &ldquo;The Arabian
Nights,&rdquo; but rather use them as charms, like Izaak Walton&rsquo;s
marrow of the thighbone of a heron or a piece of mummy.&nbsp; The bullfighter
speaks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cavaliers and strong men, this cavalier is the friend
of a friend of mine.&nbsp; <i>Es mucho hombre</i>.&nbsp; There is none
like him in Spain.&nbsp; He speaks the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>, though
he is an <i>Inglesito</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We do not believe it,&rsquo; replied several grave
voices.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not possible, say you?&nbsp; I tell you it is.&mdash;Come
forward, Balseiro, you who have been in prison all your life, and are
always boasting that you can speak the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>, though
I say you know nothing of it&mdash;come forward and speak to his worship
in the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A low, slight, but active figure stepped forward.&nbsp; He
was in his shirt sleeves, and wore a <i>montero</i> cap; his features
were handsome, but they were those of a demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spoke a few words in the broken Gypsy slang of the prison,
inquiring of me whether I had ever been in <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the
condemned cell, and whether I knew what a <i>gitana</i> was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Vamos Inglesito</i>,&rsquo; shouted Sevilla, in
a voice of thunder, &lsquo;answer the <i>monro</i> in the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I answered the robber, for such he was, and one, too, whose
name will live for many years in the ruffian histories of Madrid&mdash;I
answered him in a speech of some length, in the dialect of the Estremenian
Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe it is the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>,&rsquo; muttered
Balseiro.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is either that or English, for I understand
not a word of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did I not say to you,&rsquo; cried the bullfighter,
&lsquo;that you knew nothing of the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>?&nbsp; But
this <i>Inglesito</i> does.&nbsp; I understood all he said.&nbsp; <i>Vaya</i>,
there is none like him for the crabbed <i>Gitano</i>.&nbsp; He is a
good <i>ginete</i>, too; next to myself, there is none like him, only
he rides with stirrup leathers too short.&mdash;<i>Inglesito</i>, if
you have need of money, I will lend you my purse.&nbsp; All I have is
at your service, and that is not a little; I have just gained four thousand
<i>chul&eacute;s</i> by the lottery.&nbsp; Courage, Englishman!&nbsp;
Another cup.&nbsp; I will pay all&mdash;I, Sevilla!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he clapped his hand repeatedly on his breast, reiterating,
&lsquo;I, Sevilla!&nbsp; I&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow breaks up his own style in the same way with foreign words.&nbsp;
As Ford said in his &ldquo;Edinburgh Review&rdquo; criticism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To use a Gypsy term for a linguist, &lsquo;he knows the seven
jargons&rsquo;; his conversations and his writings resemble an intricate
mosiac, of which we see the rich effect, without comprehending the design.
. . . Mr. Borrow, in whose mouth are the tongues of Babel, selects,
as he dashes along <i>currente calamo</i>, the exact word for any idiom
which best expresses the precise idea which sparkles in his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This habit of Borrow&rsquo;s should be compared with Lamb&rsquo;s
archaisms, but, better still, with Robert Burton&rsquo;s interlardation
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>of
English and Latin in &ldquo;The Anatomy of Melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again what I may call his spotted dog style is only a part of
the whole, and as the whole is effective, we solemnly conclude that
this is due in part to the spotted dog.&nbsp; My last word is that here,
as always in a good writer, the whole is greater than the mere sum of
the parts, just as with a bad writer the part is always greater than
the whole.&nbsp; Or a truer way of saying this is that many elements
elude discovery, and therefore the whole exceeds the discoverable parts.&nbsp;
Nor is this the whole truth, for the mixing is much if not all, and
neither Borrow nor any critic knows anything about the mixing, save
that the drink is good that comes of it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>CHAPTER
XXIII&mdash;BETWEEN THE ACTS</h2>
<p>Six three-volume editions of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; were
issued within the first twelve months: ten thousand copies of a cheap
edition were sold in four months.&nbsp; In America it was sold rapidly
without benefit to Borrow.&nbsp; It was translated into German in 1844
and French in 1845.&nbsp; Borrow came up to town and did not refuse
to meet princes, bishops, ambassadors, and members of Parliament.&nbsp;
He was pleased and flattered by the sales and the reviews, and declared
that he had known it would succeed.&nbsp; He did not quite know what
to say to an invitation from the Royal Institution, but as to the Royal
Academy, it would &ldquo;just suit him,&rdquo; because he was a safe
man, he said, fitted by nature for an Academician.&nbsp; He did not
think much of episcopal food, wine, or cigars.&nbsp; He was careful
of his hero and disliked hearing him abused or treated indifferently.&nbsp;
If he had many letters, he answered but few.&nbsp; He had made nothing
yet out of literature because the getting about to receive homage, etc.,
had been so expensive: he did not care, for he hated to speak of money
matters, yet he could not but mention the fact.&nbsp; When the money
began to arrive he did not resent it by any means, as he was to buy
a blood horse with it&mdash;no less.&nbsp; His letters have a jolly,
bullying, but offhand and jerky tone, and they are very short.&nbsp;
He gives Murray advice on publishing and is willing to advise the Government
how to manage the Irish&mdash;&ldquo;the blackguards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was now, by virtue of his wife, a &ldquo;landed proprietor,&rdquo;
and filled the part with unction, though but little satisfaction.&nbsp;
<!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>For
he was not a magistrate, and he had to get up in the middle of the night
to look after &ldquo;poachers and thieves,&rdquo; as he says in giving
a reason for an illness.&nbsp; In the summer-house at Oulton hung his
father&rsquo;s coat and sword, but it is to be noticed that to the end
of his life an old friend held it &ldquo;doubtful whether his father
commenced his military career with a commission.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow
probably realised the importance of belonging to the ruling classes
and having a long steady pedigree.&nbsp; &ldquo;If report be true,&rdquo;
says the same friend, <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201">{201}</a>
&ldquo;his mother was of French origin, and in early life an actress.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The foreignness as an asset overcame his objection to the French, and
&ldquo;an actress&rdquo; also sounded unconventional.&nbsp; The friend
continues: &ldquo;But the subject of his family was one on which Borrow
never touched.&nbsp; He would allude to Borrowdale as the country whence
they came, and then would make mysterious allusions to his father&rsquo;s
pugilistic triumphs.&nbsp; But this is certain, that he has not left
a single relation behind him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he had many relatives
in Cornwall and did not scorn to visit their houses.&nbsp; He would
only talk of his works to intimate friends, and &ldquo;when he went
into company it was as a gentleman, not because he was an author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Eastlake, in March, 1844, calls him &ldquo;a fine man, but a
most disagreeable one; a kind of character that would be most dangerous
in rebellious times&mdash;one that would suffer or persecute to the
utmost.&nbsp; His face is expressive of wrong-headed determination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little earlier than this, in October, 1843, Caroline Fox saw him
&ldquo;sitting on one side of the fire and his old mother on the other.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was known to her that &ldquo;his spirits always sink in wet weather,
and to-day was very rainy, but he was courteous and not displeased to
be a little lionised, for his delicacy is not of the most susceptible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was &ldquo;a tall, <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>ungainly,
uncouth man,&rdquo; in her opinion, &ldquo;with great physical strength,
a quick penetrating eye, a confident manner, and a disagreeable tone
and pronunciation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In no place does he make anyone praise
his voice, and, as he said, it reminded one Spanish woman of a German
clockmaker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But Borrow was not happy or at ease.&nbsp; He took a riding tour
in the east of England; he walked, rowed and fished; but that was not
enough.&nbsp; He was restless, and yet did not get away.&nbsp; Evidently
he did not conceal the fact that he thought of travelling again.&nbsp;
He had talked about Africa and China: he was now talking about Constantinople
and Africa.&nbsp; He was often miserable, though he had, so far as he
knew, &ldquo;no particular disorder.&rdquo;&nbsp; If at such times he
was away from Oulton, he thought of his home as his only refuge in this
world; if he was at home he thought of travel or foreign employment.&nbsp;
His disease was, perhaps, now middle age, and too good a memory in his
blood and in his bones.&nbsp; Whatever it was it was apparently not
curable by his kind of Christianity, nor by a visit from the genial
Ford, and a present of caviare and pheasant; nor by the never-out-of-date
reminder from friends that he was very well off, etc.&nbsp; If he had
been caught by Dissenters, as he should have been, he might by this
time have had salvation, and an occupation for life, in founding a new
truculent sect of Borrovians.&nbsp; As the Rev. the Romany Rye he might
have blazed in an entertaining and becoming manner.&nbsp; As &ldquo;a
sincere member of the old-fashioned Church of England, in which he believes
there is more religion, and consequently less cant, than in any other
Church in the world,&rdquo; there was nothing for him to do but sit
down at Oulton and contemplate the fact.&nbsp; This and the other fact
that &ldquo;he eats his own bread, and is one of the very few men in
England who are independent in every sense of the word,&rdquo; were
afterwards to be made subjects for public rejoicing in the Appendix
to &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>But
in his discontent at the age of forty it cannot have been entirely satisfactory,
however flattering, to hear Ford, in the &ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish he would, on some leisure day, draw up the curtain
of his own eventful biography.&nbsp; We collected from his former work
that he was not always what he now is.&nbsp; The pursuits and society
of his youth scarcely could be denominated, in Troloppian euphemism,
<i>la cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i>; but they stood him in good
stead; then and there was he trained for the encounter of Spain . .
. whilst sowing his wild oats, he became passionately fond of horseflesh.
. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much has Mr. Borrow yet to remember, yet to tell! let
him not delay.&nbsp; His has been a life, one day of which is more crowded
than is the fourscore-year vegetation of a squire or alderman. . . .
Everything seems sealed on a memory, wax to receive and marble to retain.&nbsp;
He is not subjective.&nbsp; He has the new fault of not talking about
self.&nbsp; We vainly want to know what sort of person must be the pilgrim
in whose wanderings we have been interested.&nbsp; That he has left
to other pens. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ford went on to identify Borrow with the mysterious Unknown
of Colonel Napier&rsquo;s newly-published book.</p>
<p>He began to write his autobiography to fulfil the expectations of
Ford and his own public.&nbsp; It was not until 1844, exactly four years
after his return from Spain, that he set out again on foreign travel.&nbsp;
He made stops at Paris, Vienna, Constantinople, Venice, and Rome, but
spent most of his time in Hungary and Roumania, visiting the Gypsies
and compiling a &ldquo;vocabulary of the Gypsy language as spoken in
Hungary and Transylvania,&rdquo; which still exists in manuscript.&nbsp;
He was seven months away altogether.</p>
<p>Knapp possessed documents proving that Borrow was at this and that
place, and the Gypsy vocabulary is in the <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>British
Museum, but little other record of these seven months remains.&nbsp;
Knapp, indeed, takes it for granted that the historical conversation
between Borrow and the Magyar in &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; was drawn
from his experiences in Hungary and Transylvania in the year 1844; but
that is absurd, as the chapter might have been written by a man born
and bred in the reading room of the British Museum who had never met
any but similar unfortunates.&nbsp; It is very likely that the journey
was a failure, and if it had been a success, an account of it would
have interrupted the progress of the autobiography, as Ford expected
it to do.&nbsp; But the thing was too deliberate to succeed.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
right instinct was to get work which would take him abroad; he failed,
and so he travelled because travel offered him relief from his melancholy
and unrest.&nbsp; Whether or no he &ldquo;satisfied his roving demon
for a time,&rdquo; as Mr. Walling puts it, is unknown.&nbsp; What is
known is that he did not make this journey a subject of mystery or boasting,
and that he stayed in England thereafter.&nbsp; He had tasted comfort
and celebrity; he had a wife; he was an older man, looking weak in the
eyes by the time he was fifty; and he had no motive for travel except
discontent with staying at home.&nbsp; He tried to get away again on
a mission to the Convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, to acquire
manuscripts for the British Museum; but he failed, and the manuscripts
went to St. Petersburg instead of Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>In 1843 Henry Wyndham Phillips, R.A., painted his portrait.&nbsp;
He was a restless sitter until the painter remarked: &ldquo;I have always
heard, Mr. Borrow, that the Persian is a very fine language; is it so?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is, Phillips; it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you will
not mind reciting me something in the Persian tongue?&rdquo; said Phillips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me, no; certainly not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then &ldquo;Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s face lit up with the light that Phillips longed for,
and he kept declaiming <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>at
the top of his voice, while the painter made the most of his opportunity.&rdquo;
<a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205">{205}</a>&nbsp; According
to the story, Phillips had the like success with Turkish and Armenian,
and successfully stilled Borrow&rsquo;s desire &ldquo;to get out into
the fresh air and sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same way, writing and literary ambition kept Borrow from travel.&nbsp;
He stayed at home and he wrote &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; where, speaking
of the rapid flow of time in the years of his youth, he says: &ldquo;Since
then it has flagged often enough; sometimes it has seemed to stand entirely
still: and the reader may easily judge how it fares at the present,
from the circumstance of my taking pen in hand, and endeavouring to
write down the passages of my life&mdash;a last resource with most people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At one moment he got satisfaction from professing scorn of authorship,
at another, speaking of Byron, he reflected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps after all it was better to have been mighty
Milton in his poverty and blindness&mdash;witty and ingenious Butler
consigned to the tender mercies of bailiffs, and starving Otway; they
might enjoy more real pleasure than this lordling; they must have been
aware that the world would one day do them justice&mdash;fame after
death is better than the top of fashion in life.&nbsp; They have left
a fame behind them which shall never die, whilst this lordling&mdash;a
time will come when he will be out of fashion and forgotten.&nbsp; And
yet I don&rsquo;t know; didn&rsquo;t he write Childe Harold and that
ode?&nbsp; Yes, he wrote Childe Harold and that ode.&nbsp; Then a time
will scarcely come when he will be forgotten.&nbsp; Lords, squires,
and cockneys may pass away, but a time will scarcely come when Childe
Harold and that ode will be forgotten.&nbsp; He was a poet, after all&mdash;and
he must have known it; a real poet, equal to&mdash;to&mdash;what a destiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>It
is said that in actual life Borrow refused to be introduced to a Russian
scholar &ldquo;simply because he moved in the literary world.&rdquo;
<a name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206">{206}</a></p>
<p>Yet again he made the glorious Gypsy say that he would rather be
a book-writer than a fighting-man, because the book-writers &ldquo;have
so much to say for themselves even when dead and gone&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When they are laid in the churchyard, it is their own
fault if people a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t talking of them.&nbsp; Who will know,
after I am dead, or bitchadey pawdel, that I was once the beauty of
the world, or that you, Jasper, were&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The best man in England of my inches.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
true, Tawno&mdash;however, here&rsquo;s our brother will perhaps let
the world know something about us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should think, too, that Borrow was both questioner and answerer
in the conversation with the literary man who had the touching mania:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With respect to your present troubles and anxieties,
would it not be wise, seeing that authorship causes you so much trouble
and anxiety, to give it up altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Were you an author yourself,&rsquo; replied my host,
&lsquo;you would not talk in this manner; once an author, ever an author&mdash;besides,
what could I do? return to my former state of vegetation? no, much as
I endure, I do not wish that; besides, every now and then my reason
tells me that these troubles and anxieties of mine are utterly without
foundation; that whatever I write is the legitimate growth of my own
mind, and that it is the height of folly to afflict myself at any chance
resemblance between my own thoughts and those of other writers, such
resemblance being inevitable from the fact of our common human origin.
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knapp gives at length a story showing what an author Borrow was,
and how little his travels had sweetened him.&nbsp; <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>He
had long promised to review Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook for Spain,&rdquo;
when it should appear.&nbsp; In 1845 he wrote an article and sent it
in to the &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; as a review of the Handbook.&nbsp;
It had nothing to do with the book and very little to do with the subject
of the book, and Lockhart, the &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; editor, suggested
turning it into a review by a few interpolations and extracts.&nbsp;
Borrow would not have the article touched.&nbsp; Both Lockhart and Ford
advised him to send it to &ldquo;Fraser&rsquo;s&rdquo; or another magazine
where it was certain to be welcomed as a Spanish essay by the author
of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no: and the article was
never printed anywhere.</p>
<p>Yet Borrow was not settling down to authorship pure and simple.&nbsp;
He flew into a passion because a new railway line, in 1846, ran through
his estate.&nbsp; He flew into a passion, did nothing, and remained
on his estates until 1853, when he and his family went into lodgings
at Yarmouth.&nbsp; I have not discovered how much he profited by the
intrusion of the railway, except when he pilloried the contractor, his
neighbour, Mr. Peto, as Flamson, in the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany
Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he tried again to be put on the Commission of
the Peace, with no success.&nbsp; He probably spent much of his time
in being either suspicious, or ambitious, or indignant.&nbsp; In 1847,
for example, he suspected his friend Dr. Bowring&mdash;his &ldquo;only
friend&rdquo; in 1842&mdash;of using his work to get for himself the
consulship at Canton, which he was professing to obtain for Borrow.&nbsp;
The result was the foaming abuse of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; where
Bowring is the old Radical.&nbsp; The affair of the Sinai manuscripts
followed close on this.&nbsp; All that he saw of foreign lands was at
the Exhibition of 1851, where he frequently accosted foreigners in their
own tongue, so that it began to be whispered about that he was &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo;:
he excited so much remark that his daughter thought it better to drag
him away.</p>
<p><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>He
was suffering from ill-health and untranquility of mind which gave his
mother anxiety, though his physical strength appears not to have degenerated,
for in 1853, at Yarmouth, he rescued a man out of a stormy sea.&nbsp;
He was an unpleasant companion for those whom he did not like or could
not get on with.&nbsp; Thackeray tried to get up a conversation with
him, his final effort being the question, &ldquo;Have you seen my &lsquo;Snob
Papers&rsquo; in &lsquo;Punch&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which Borrow answered:
&ldquo;In &lsquo;Punch&rsquo;?&nbsp; It is a periodical I never look
at.&rdquo;&nbsp; He once met Miss Agnes Strickland:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow was unwilling to be introduced, but was prevailed on
to submit.&nbsp; He sat down at her side; before long she spoke with
rapture of his works, and asked his permission to send him a copy of
her &lsquo;Queens of England.&rsquo;&nbsp; He exclaimed, &lsquo;For
God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t, madam, I should not know where to put
them or what to do with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; On this he rose, fuming,
as was his wont when offended, and said to Mr. Donne, &lsquo;What a
damned fool that woman is!&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact is that, whenever Borrow
was induced to do anything unwillingly, he lost his temper.&rdquo; <a name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208">{208}</a></p>
<p>The friend who tells this story, Gordon Hake, a poet and doctor at
Bury St. Edmunds, tells also that once when he was at dinner with a
banker who had recently &ldquo;struck the docket&rdquo; to secure payment
from a friend of Borrow&rsquo;s, and the banker&rsquo;s wife said to
him: &ldquo;Oh Mr. Borrow, I have read your books with so much pleasure!&rdquo;
the great man exclaimed: &ldquo;Pray, what books do you mean, madam?&nbsp;
Do you mean my account books?&rdquo;&nbsp; How touchy he was, Mr. Walling
shows, by his story of Borrow in Cornwall neglecting a lady all one
evening because she bore the name of the man his father had knocked
down at Menheniot Fair.&nbsp; Several <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>stories
of his crushing remarks prove nothing but that he was big and alarming
and uncontrolled.</p>
<p class="picture">

</a></p>
<p>Very little record of his friendly intercourse with men at this middle
period remains.&nbsp; Several letters, of 1853, 1856 and 1857, alone
survive to show that he met and received letters from Fitzgerald.&nbsp;
That Fitzgerald enjoyed an evening with him in 1856 tells us little;
and even so it appears that Fitzgerald only wanted to ask him to read
some of the &ldquo;Northern Ballads&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;but you shut
the book&rdquo;&mdash;and that he doubted whether Borrow wished to keep
up the acquaintance.&nbsp; They had friends in common, and Fitzgerald
had sent Borrow a copy of his &ldquo;Six Dramas of Calderon,&rdquo;
in 1853, confessing that he had had thoughts of sending the manuscript
first for an inspection.&nbsp; He also told Borrow when he was about
to make the &ldquo;dangerous experiment&rdquo; of marriage with Miss
Barton &ldquo;of Quaker memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1857 Borrow came to
see him and had the loan of the &ldquo;Rubaiyat&rdquo; in manuscript,
and Fitzgerald showed his readiness to see more of the &ldquo;Great
Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1859 he sent Borrow a copy of &ldquo;Omar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He found Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;masterful manners and irritable temper
uncongenial,&rdquo; <a name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209">{209}</a>
but succeeded, unlike many other friends, in having no quarrel with
him.&nbsp; Near the end of his life, in 1875, it was Borrow that tried
to renew the acquaintance, but in vain, for Fitzgerald reminded him
that friends &ldquo;exist and enjoy themselves pretty reasonably without
me,&rdquo; and asked, was not being alone better than having company?</p>
<p>If Borrow had little consideration for others&rsquo; feelings, his
consideration for his own was exquisite, as this story, belonging to
1856, may help to prove:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three personages in the world whom he always had
a desire to see; two of these had slipped through his fingers, so he
was determined to see the third.&nbsp; <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>&lsquo;Pray,
Mr. Borrow, who were they?&rsquo;&nbsp; He held up three fingers of
his left hand and pointed them off with the forefinger of the right:
the first, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell; the second, Lamplighter (the sire
of Phosphorus, Lord Berners&rsquo;s winner of the Derby); the third,
Anna Gurney. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>One spring day during the Crimean War, when he was walking round
Norfolk, he sent word to Anna Gurney to announce his coming, and she
was ready to receive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, according to his account, he had been but a very short
time in her presence, she wheeled her chair round and reached her hand
to one of her bookshelves and took down an Arabic Grammar, and put it
into his hand, asking for explanation of some difficult point, which
he tried to decipher; but meanwhile she talked to him continuously;
when, said he, &lsquo;I could not study the Arabic Grammar and listen
to her at the same time, so I threw down the book and ran out of the
room.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seems not to have stopped running till he reached
Old Tucker&rsquo;s Inn, at Cromer, where he renewed his strength, or
calmed his temper, with five excellent sausages, and then came on to
Sheringham. . . .&rdquo; <a name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a">{210a}</a></p>
<p>The distance is a very good two miles, and Borrow&rsquo;s age was
forty-nine.</p>
<p>He is said also to have been considerate towards his mother, the
poor, and domestic animals.&nbsp; Probably he and his mother understood
one another.&nbsp; When he could not write to her, he got his wife to
do so; and from 1849 she lived with them at Oulton.&nbsp; As to the
poor, Knapp tells us that he left behind him letters of gratitude or
acknowledgment from individuals, churches, and chapels.&nbsp; As to
animals, once when he came upon some men beating a horse that had fallen,
he gave it ale of sufficient quantity and strength to set it soon upon
the road trotting with the rest of its kind, after the men had received
a lecture. <a name="citation210b"></a><a href="#footnote210b">{210b}</a>&nbsp;
It is <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>also
related that when a favourite old cat crawled out to die in the hedge
he brought it into the house, where he &ldquo;laid it down in a comfortable
spot and watched it till it was dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; His horse, Sidi Habismilk,
the Arab, seems to have returned his admiration and esteem.&nbsp; He
said himself, in &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; after expressing his relief
that a boy and dog had not seen a weazel that ran across his path:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to see poor wild animals persecuted and murdered, lose
my appetite for dinner at hearing the screams of a hare pursued by greyhounds,
and am silly enough to feel disgust and horror at the squeals of a rat
in the fangs of a terrier, which one of the sporting tribe once told
me were the sweetest sounds in &lsquo;natur.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>CHAPTER
XXIV&mdash;&ldquo;LAVENGRO&rdquo; AND &ldquo;THE ROMANY RYE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Instead of travelling over the world Borrow wrote his autobiography
and spent so many years on it that his contempt for the pen had some
excuse.&nbsp; I have already said almost all there is to say about these
labours. <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212">{212}</a>&nbsp;
Knapp has shown that they were protracted to include matters relating
to Bowring and long posterior to the period covered by the autobiography,
and that the magnitude of these additions compelled him to divide the
book in two.&nbsp; The first part was &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; published
in 1851, with an ending that is now, and perhaps was then, obviously
due to the knife.&nbsp; The sceptical and hostile criticism of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
delayed the appearance of the remainder of the autobiography, &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow had to reply to his critics and explain himself.&nbsp; This
he did in the Appendix, and thus changed, the book was finished in 1853
or 1854.&nbsp; Something in Murray&rsquo;s attitude while they were
discussing publication mounted Borrow on the high horse, and yet again
he fumed because Murray had expressed a private opinion and had revealed
his feeling that the book was not likely to make money for anyone.</p>
<p class="picture">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; describe
the author&rsquo;s early adventures and, at the same time, his later
opinions and mature character.&nbsp; In some places he turns openly
aside to express his feeling or opinion at the time of writing, as,
for example, in his praise of the Orangemen, <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>or,
on the very first page, where he claims to spring from a family of gentlemen,
though &ldquo;not very wealthy,&rdquo; that the reader may see at once
he is &ldquo;not altogether of low and plebeian origin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But by far more important is the indirect self-revelation when he is
recalling that other distant self, the child of three or of ten, the
youth of twenty.</p>
<p>Ford had asked Borrow for a book of his adventures and travels, something
&ldquo;thick and slab,&rdquo; to follow &ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The result shows that Borrow had almost done with outward adventure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; had an atmosphere composed at best
of as much Spain as Borrow.&nbsp; But the autobiography is pure inward
Borrow: except a few detachable incidents there is nothing in it which
is not Borrow&rsquo;s creation, nothing which would have any value apart
from his own treatment of it.&nbsp; A man might have used &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain&rdquo; as a kind of guide to men and places in 1843,
and it is possible he would not have been wholly disappointed.&nbsp;
The autobiography does not depend on anything outside itself, but creates
its own atmosphere and dwells in it without admitting that of the outer
world&mdash;no: not even by references to events like the campaign of
Waterloo or the funeral of Byron; and, as if conscious that this other
atmosphere must be excluded, Borrow has hardly mentioned a name which
could act upon the reader as a temporary check to the charm.&nbsp; When
he does recall contemporary events, and speaks as a Briton to Britons,
the rant is of a brave degree that is almost as much his own, and it
makes more intense than ever the solitude and inwardness of the individual
life going on side by side with war and with politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant were those days of my early boyhood; and a melancholy
pleasure steals over me as I recall them.&nbsp; Those were stirring
times of which I am speaking, and there was much passing around me calculated
to captivate the imagination.&nbsp; The dreadful struggle which so long
<!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>convulsed
Europe, and in which England bore so prominent a part, was then at its
hottest; we were at war, and determination and enthusiasm shone in every
face; man, woman and child were eager to fight the Frank, the hereditary,
but, thank God, never dreaded enemy of the Anglo-Saxon race.&nbsp; &lsquo;Love
your country and beat the French, and then never mind what happens,&rsquo;
was the cry of entire England.&nbsp; Oh those were days of power, gallant
days, bustling days, worth the bravest days of chivalry, at least; tall
battalions of native warriors were marching through the land; there
was the glitter of the bayonet and the gleam of the sabre; the shrill
squeak of the fife and loud rattling of the drum were heard in the streets
of county towns, and the loyal shouts of the inhabitants greeted the
soldiery on their arrival or cheered them at their departure.&nbsp;
And now let us leave the upland and descend to the sea-board; there
is a sight for you upon the billows!&nbsp; A dozen men-of-war are gliding
majestically out of port, their long buntings streaming from the top-gallant
masts, calling on the skulking Frenchman to come forth from his bights
and bays; and what looms upon us yonder from the fog-bank in the East?&nbsp;
A gallant frigate towing behind her the long low hull of a crippled
privateer, which but three short days ago had left Dieppe to skim the
sea, and whose crew of ferocious hearts are now cursing their impudence
in an English hold.&nbsp; Stirring times those, which I love to recall,
for they were days of gallantry and enthusiasm, and were moreover the
days of my boyhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant were those days,&rdquo; and there is a &ldquo;melancholy
pleasure&rdquo; in recalling them.&nbsp; The two combine in this autobiography
with strange effect, for they set the man side by side with the child
as an invisible companion haunting him.</p>
<p>Whatever was the change that came over Borrow in the &rsquo;forties,
and showed itself in melancholy and unrest, this <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>long-continued
contemplation of his childhood betrayed him into a profound change of
tone.&nbsp; Neither Africa nor the East could have shown him as much
mystery as this wide England of a child ignorant of geography, and it
kept hold of him for twice as long as Spain.&nbsp; It offered him relief
and escape, and gladly did he accept them, and deeply he indulged in
them.&nbsp; He found that he had that within himself as wild as any
mountain or maniac-haunted ruin of Spain.&nbsp; For example, he recalled
his schooldays in Ireland, and how one day he set out to visit his elder
brother, the boy lieutenant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The distance was rather considerable, yet I hoped to be back
by evening fall, for I was now a shrewd walker, thanks to constant practice.&nbsp;
I set out early, and, directing my course towards the north, I had in
less than two hours accomplished considerably more than half of the
journey.&nbsp; The weather had been propitious: a slight frost had rendered
the ground firm to the tread, and the skies were clear; but now a change
came over the scene, the skies darkened, and a heavy snow-storm came
on; the road then lay straight through a bog, and was bounded by a deep
trench on both sides; I was making the best of my way, keeping as nearly
as I could in the middle of the road, lest, blinded by the snow which
was frequently borne into my eyes by the wind, I might fall into the
dyke, when all at once I heard a shout to windward, and turning my eyes
I saw the figure of a man, and what appeared to be an animal of some
kind, coming across the bog with great speed, in the direction of myself;
the nature of the ground seemed to offer but little impediment to these
beings, both clearing the holes and abysses which lay in their way with
surprising agility; the animal was, however, some slight way in advance,
and, bounding over the dyke, appeared on the road just before me.&nbsp;
It was a dog, of what species I cannot tell, never having seen the like
before or since; <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>the
head was large and round; the ears so tiny as scarcely to be discernible;
the eyes of a fiery red; in size it was rather small than large; and
the coat, which was remarkably smooth, as white as the falling flakes.&nbsp;
It placed itself directly in my path, and showing its teeth, and bristling
its coat, appeared determined to prevent my progress.&nbsp; I had an
ashen stick in my hand, with which I threatened it; this, however, only
served to increase its fury; it rushed upon me, and I had the utmost
difficulty to preserve myself from its fangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doing with the dog, the fairy dog?&rsquo;
said a man, who at this time likewise cleared the dyke at a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very tall man, rather well dressed as it should seem;
his garments, however, were like my own, so covered with snow that I
could scarcely discern their quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are ye doing with the dog of peace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish he would show himself one,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I
said nothing to him, but he placed himself in my road, and would not
let me pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course he would not be letting you till he knew
where ye were going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not much of a fairy,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or
he would know that without asking; tell him that I am going to see my
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who is your brother, little Sas?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What my father is, a royal soldier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, ye are going then to the detachment at ---; by
my shoul, I have a good mind to be spoiling your journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are doing that already,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;keeping
me here talking about dogs and fairies; you had better go home and get
some salve to cure that place over your eye; it&rsquo;s catching cold
you&rsquo;ll be in so much snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one side of the man&rsquo;s forehead there was a raw and
staring wound, as if from a recent and terrible blow.</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Faith,
then, I&rsquo;ll be going, but it&rsquo;s taking you wid me I will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And where will you take me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, then, to Ryan&rsquo;s Castle, little Sas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You do not speak the language very correctly,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;it is not Sas you should call me&mdash;&rsquo;tis Sassanach,&rsquo;
and forthwith I accompanied the word with a speech full of flowers of
Irish rhetoric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man looked upon me for a moment, fixedly, then, bending
his head towards his breast, he appeared to be undergoing a kind of
convulsion, which was accompanied by a sound something resembling laughter;
presently he looked at me, and there was a broad grin on his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By my shoul, it&rsquo;s a thing of peace I&rsquo;m
thinking ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now with a whisking sound came running down the road a
hare; it was nearly upon us before it perceived us; suddenly stopping
short, however, it sprang into the bog on the right-hand side; after
it amain bounded the dog of peace, followed by the man, but not until
he had nodded to me a farewell salutation.&nbsp; In a few moments I
lost sight of him amidst the snow-flakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is more magical than nine-tenths of the deliberately Celtic
prose or verse.&nbsp; I mean that it is real and credible and yet insubstantial,
the too too solid flesh is melted into something like the mist over
the bogland, and it recalls to us times when an account of our physical
self, height, width, weight, colour, age, etc., would bear no relation
whatever to the true self.&nbsp; In part, this effect may be due to
Ireland and to the fact that Borrow was only there for one short impressionable
year of his boyhood, and had never seen any other country like it.&nbsp;
But most of it is due to Borrow&rsquo;s nature and the conditions under
which the autobiography was composed.&nbsp; While he was writing it
he was probably living a more solitary and sedentary life than ever
before, and could hear the voices of solitude; he was not the busy <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>riding
missionary of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; nor the f&ecirc;ted
author, but the unsocial morbid tinker, philologist, boxer, and religious
doubter.&nbsp; It has been said that &ldquo;he was a Celt of Celts.&nbsp;
His genius was truly Celtic.&rdquo; <a name="citation218a"></a><a href="#footnote218a">{218a}</a>&nbsp;
It has been said that &ldquo;he inherited nothing from Norfolk save
his accent and his love of &lsquo;leg of mutton and turnips.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<a name="citation218b"></a><a href="#footnote218b">{218b}</a>&nbsp;
Yet his father, the Cornish &ldquo;Celt,&rdquo; appears to have been
entirely unlike him, while he draws his mother, the Norfolk Huguenot,
as innately sympathetic with himself.&nbsp; I am content to leave this
mystery for Celts and anti-Celts to grow lean on.&nbsp; I have known
Celts who said that five and five were ten or, at most, eleven; and
Saxons who said twenty-five, and even fifty-five.</p>
<p>Borrow was writing without note books: things had therefore in his
memory the importance which his nature had decreed for them, and among
these things no doubt he exercised a conscious choice.&nbsp; Behind
all was the inexplicable singular force which, Celtic or not, gave the
&ldquo;dream&rdquo;-like, illusory quality which pervades the books
in spite of more positive and arresting qualities sometimes apparently
hostile to this one.&nbsp; It is true that his books have in them many
rude or simple characters of Gypsies, jockeys, and others, living chiefly
by their hands, and it is part of the conscious and unconscious object
of the books to exalt them.&nbsp; But these people in Borrow&rsquo;s
hands seldom or never give the impression of coarse solid bodies well
endowed with the principal appetites.&nbsp; There is, for example, a
famous page where the young doubting Borrow listens to a Wesleyan preacher
and wishes that his life had been like that man&rsquo;s, and then comes
upon his Gypsy friend after a long absence.&nbsp; He asks the Gypsy
for news and hears of some deaths:</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;What
is your opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro?&rsquo; said I, as I sat down
beside him</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My opinion of death, brother, is much the same as that
in the old song of Pharaoh, which I have heard my grandam sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Canna marel o manus chivios and&eacute; puv,<br />
Ta rovel pa leste o chavo ta romi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a man dies, he is cast into the earth, and his wife and child
sorrow over him.&nbsp; If he has neither wife nor child, then his father
and mother, I suppose; and if he is quite alone in the world, why, then,
he is cast into the earth, and there is an end of the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And do you think that is the end of man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s an end of him, brother, more&rsquo;s
the pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you say so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Think so!&mdash;There&rsquo;s night and day, brother,
both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother, all sweet things;
there&rsquo;s likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet,
brother; who would wish to die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would wish to die&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You talk like a gorgio&mdash;which is the same as talking
like a fool&mdash;were you a Rommany Chal you would talk wiser.&nbsp;
Wish to die, indeed!&mdash;A Rommany Chal would wish to live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if I
could only feel that, I would gladly live for ever.&nbsp; Dosta, we&rsquo;ll
now go to the tents and put on the gloves; and I&rsquo;ll try to make
you feel what a sweet thing it is to be alive, brother!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how delicate it is, the two lads talking amidst the furze of
Mousehold Heath at sunset.&nbsp; And so with the rest.&nbsp; <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>As
he grows older the atmosphere thins but never quite fades away; even
Thurtell, the bull-necked friend of bruisers, is as much a spirit as
a man.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton has complained <a name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220">{220}</a>
that Borrow makes Isopel taller than Borrow, and therefore too tall
for beauty.&nbsp; But Borrow was not writing for readers who knew, or
for those who, if they knew, always remembered, that he was six-feet-two.&nbsp;
We know that Lavengro is tall, but we are not told so just before hearing
that Isopel is taller; and the effect is that we think, not too distinctly,
of a girl who somehow succeeds in being very tall and beautiful.&nbsp;
If Borrow had said: &ldquo;Whereas I was six feet two inches, the girl
was six feet two and three-quarter inches,&rdquo; it would have been
different, and it would not have been Borrow, who, as I say, was not
writing of ponderable, measurable bodies, but of possible immortal souls
curiously dressed in flesh that can be almost as invisible.&nbsp; So
again, Mr. Watts-Dunton says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to Isopel Berners, neither Lavengro, nor the man
she thrashed when he stole one of her flaxen hairs to conjure with,
gives the reader the faintest idea of Isopel&rsquo;s method of attack
or defence, and we have to take her prowess on trust.&nbsp; In a word
Borrow was content to give us the wonderful, without taking that trouble
to find for it a logical basis which a literary master would have taken.&nbsp;
And instances might easily be multiplied of this exaggeration of Borrow&rsquo;s,
which is apt to lend a sense of unreality to some of the most picturesque
pages of &lsquo;Lavengro.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would Mr. Watts-Dunton seriously like to have these scenes touched
up by Driscoll or Sullivan.&nbsp; Borrow did not write for real or imaginary
connoisseurs.</p>
<p>I do not mean that a man need sacrifice his effect upon <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>the
ordinary man by satisfying the connoisseur.&nbsp; No one, for example,
will deny that a ship by Mr. Joseph Conrad is as beautiful and intelligible
as one by Stevenson; but neither would it be safe to foretell that Mr.
Conrad&rsquo;s, the more accurate, will seem the more like life in fifty
years&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Borrow is never technical.&nbsp; If he quotes
Gypsy it is not for the sake of the colour effect on those who read
Gypsy as they run.&nbsp; His effects are for a certain distance and
in a certain atmosphere where technicality would be impertinent.</p>
<p>Mr. Hindes Groome <a name="citation221a"></a><a href="#footnote221a">{221a}</a>
was more justified in saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Borrow, no doubt, knows the Gypsies well, and could describe
them perfectly.&nbsp; But his love of effect leads him away.&nbsp; In
his wish to impress his reader with a certain mysterious notion of himself,
he colours his Gypsy pictures (the <i>form</i> of which is quite accurate)
in a fantastic style, which robs them altogether of the value they would
have as studies from life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Groome wrote simply as a Gypsy student.&nbsp; He collected data
which can be verified, but do not often give an impression of life,
except the life of a young Cambridge man who is devoted to Gypsies.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um&rdquo; reviewer <a name="citation221b"></a><a href="#footnote221b">{221b}</a>
begs the question by calling the Gypsy dialogues of Hindes Groome, photographic;
and is plainly inaccurate in saying that if they are compared with those
in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; &ldquo;the illusion in Borrow&rsquo;s narrative
is disturbed by the uncolloquial vocabulary of the speakers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For Borrow&rsquo;s dialogues do produce an effect of some kind of life;
those of Hindes Groome instruct us or pique our curiosity, but unless
we know Gypsies, they produce no life-like effect.</p>
<p>Who else but Borrow could make the old viper-catcher thus describe
the King of the Vipers?&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>&ldquo;It
may be about seven years ago that I happened to be far down yonder to
the west, on the other side of England, nearly two hundred miles from
here, following my business.&nbsp; It was a very sultry day, I remember,
and I had been out several hours catching creatures.&nbsp; It might
be about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when I found myself on
some heathy land near the sea, on the ridge of a hill, the side of which,
nearly as far down as the sea, was heath; but on the top there was arable
ground, which had been planted, and from which the harvest had been
gathered&mdash;oats or barley, I know not which&mdash;but I remember
that the ground was covered with stubble.&nbsp; Well, about three o&rsquo;clock,
as I told you before, what with the heat of the day and from having
walked about for hours in a lazy way, I felt very tired; so I determined
to have a sleep, and I laid myself down, my head just on the ridge of
the hill, towards the field, and my body over the side down amongst
the heath; my bag, which was nearly filled with creatures, lay at a
little distance from my face; the creatures were struggling in it, I
remember, and I thought to myself, how much more comfortably off I was
than they; I was taking my ease on the nice open hill, cooled with the
breezes, whilst they were in the nasty close bag, coiling about one
another, and breaking their very hearts all to no purpose; and I felt
quite comfortable and happy in the thought, and little by little closed
my eyes, and fell into the sweetest snooze that ever I was in in all
my life; and there I lay over the hill&rsquo;s side, with my head half
in the field, I don&rsquo;t know how long, all dead asleep.&nbsp; At
last it seemed to me that I heard a noise in my sleep, something like
a thing moving, very faint, however, far away; then it died, and then
it came again upon my ear, as I slept, and now it appeared almost as
if I heard crackle, crackle; then it died again, or I became yet more
dead asleep than before, I know not which, but <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>I
certainly lay some time without hearing it.&nbsp; All of a sudden I
became awake, and there was I, on the ridge of the hill, with my cheek
on the ground towards the stubble, with a noise in my ear like that
of something moving towards me, among the stubble of the field; well,
I lay a moment or two listening to the noise, and then I became frightened,
for I did not like the noise at all, it sounded so odd; so I rolled
myself on my belly, and looked towards the stubble.&nbsp; Mercy upon
us! there was a huge snake, or rather a dreadful viper, for it was all
yellow and gold, moving towards me, bearing its head about a foot and
a half above the ground, the dry stubble crackling beneath its outrageous
belly.&nbsp; It might be about five yards off when I first saw it, making
straight towards me, child, as if it would devour me.&nbsp; I lay quite
still, for I was stupefied with horror, whilst the creature came still
nearer; and now it was nearly upon me, when it suddenly drew back a
little, and then&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;it lifted its head and
chest high in the air, and high over my face as I looked up, flickering
at me with its tongue as if it would fly at my face.&nbsp; Child, what
I felt at that moment I can scarcely say, but it was a sufficient punishment
for all the sins I ever committed; and there we two were, I looking
up at the viper, and the viper looking down upon me, flickering at me
with its tongue.&nbsp; It was only the kindness of God that saved me:
all at once there was a loud noise, the report of a gun, for a fowler
was shooting at a covey of birds, a little way off in the stubble.&nbsp;
Whereupon the viper sunk its head and immediately made off over the
ridge of the hill, down in the direction of the sea.&nbsp; As it passed
by me, however&mdash;and it passed close by me&mdash;it hesitated a
moment, as if it was doubtful whether it should not seize me; it did
not, however, but made off down the hill.&nbsp; It has often struck
me that he was angry with me, and came upon me unawares <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>for
presuming to meddle with his people, as I have always been in the habit
of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passages quoted from &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; are representative
only of the <i>spirit</i> of the book, which, as I have suggested, diminishes
with Borrow&rsquo;s increasing years, but pervades the physical activity,
the &ldquo;low life&rdquo; and open air, and prevails over them.&nbsp;
I will give one other example of his by no means everyday magic&mdash;the
incident of the poisoned cake.&nbsp; The Gypsy girl Leonora discovers
him and betrays him to his enemy, old hairy Mrs. Herne:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaning my back against the tree I was not long in falling
into a slumber; I quite clearly remember that slumber of mine beneath
the ash tree, for it was about the sweetest slumber that I ever enjoyed;
how long I continued in it I don&rsquo;t know; I could almost have wished
that it had lasted to the present time.&nbsp; All of a sudden it appeared
to me that a voice cried in my ear, &lsquo;Danger! danger! danger!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Nothing seemingly could be more distinct than the words which I heard;
then an uneasy sensation came over me, which I strove to get rid of,
and at last succeeded, for I awoke.&nbsp; The Gypsy girl was standing
just opposite to me, with her eyes fixed upon my countenance; a singular
kind of little dog stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;was it you that cried danger?&nbsp;
What danger is there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Danger, brother, there is no danger; what danger should
there be?&nbsp; I called to my little dog, but that was in the wood;
my little dog&rsquo;s name is not danger, but stranger; what danger
should there be, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, indeed, except in sleeping beneath a tree; what
is that you have got in your hand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Something for you,&rsquo; said the girl, sitting down
and proceeding to untie a white napkin; &lsquo;a pretty manricli, so
sweet, so nice; when I went home to my people I told my grandbebee how
kind you had been to the poor person&rsquo;s <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>child,
and when my grandbebee saw the kekaubi, she said, &ldquo;Hir mi devlis,
it won&rsquo;t do for the poor people to be ungrateful; by my God, I
will bake a cake for the young harko mescro.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there are two cakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, brother, two cakes, both for you; my grandbebee
meant them both for you&mdash;but list, brother, I will have one of
them for bringing them.&nbsp; I know you will give me one, pretty brother,
grey-haired brother&mdash;which shall I have, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the napkin were two round cakes, seemingly made of rich
and costly compounds, and precisely similar in form, each weighing about
half a pound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which shall I have, brother?&rsquo; said the Gypsy
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whichever you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, brother, no, the cakes are yours, not mine, it
is for you to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, give me the one nearest you, and take the
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, brother, yes,&rsquo; said the girl; and taking
the cakes, she flung them into the air two or three times, catching
them as they fell, and singing the while.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty brother,
grey-haired brother&mdash;here, brother,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;here
is your cake, this other is mine. . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot afford to quote the whole passage, but it is at once as
real and as phantasmal as the witch scene in &ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He eats the poisoned cake and lies deadly sick.&nbsp; Mrs. Herne and
Leonora came to see the effect of the poison:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha, ha! bebee, and here he lies, poisoned like a hog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have taken drows, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Herne;
&lsquo;do you hear, sir? drows; tip him a stave, child, of the song
of poison.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>&ldquo;And
thereupon the girl clapped her hands, and sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rommany churl<br />
And the Rommany girl<br />
To-morrow shall hie<br />
To poison the sty,<br />
And bewitch on the mead<br />
The farmer&rsquo;s steed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you hear that, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs. Herne; &lsquo;the
child has tipped you a stave of the song of poison: that is, she has
sung it Christianly, though perhaps you would like to hear it Romanly;
you were always fond of what was Roman.&nbsp; Tip it him Romanly, child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not much use to remark on &ldquo;the uncolloquial vocabulary
of the speakers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Iago&rsquo;s vocabulary is not colloquial
when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not poppy nor mandragora<br />
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world<br />
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br />
That thou ow&rsquo;dst yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow is not describing Gypsy life but the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; of
his own early life.&nbsp; I should say that he succeeds, because his
words work upon the indifferent reader in something like the same way
as memory worked upon himself.&nbsp; The physical activity, the &ldquo;low
life,&rdquo; and the open air of the books are powerful.&nbsp; These
and the England of his youth gave Borrow his refuge from middle age
and Victorian England of the middle class.&nbsp; &ldquo;Youth,&rdquo;
he says in &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; &ldquo;is the only season for
enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of one&rsquo;s life are worth
all the rest of the longest life of man, even though these five and
twenty be spent in penury and contempt, and the rest in the possession
of wealth, honour, respectability, ay, and many of them in strength
and health. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Still more emphatically did he think
the same when he was looking on his past life in the dingle, feeling
his arms and thighs and teeth, which were strong and sound; &ldquo;so
now was the time <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>to
labour, to marry, to eat strong flesh, and beget strong children&mdash;the
power of doing all this would pass away with youth, which was terribly
transitory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="picture">

</a></p>
<p>Youth and strength or their extreme opposites alone attracted him,
and therefore he is best in writing of men, if we except the tall Brynhild,
Isopel, and the old witch, Mrs. Herne, than whom &ldquo;no she bear
of Lapland ever looked more fierce and hairy.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same
breath as he praises youth he praises England, pouring scorn on those
who traverse Spain and Portugal in quest of adventures, &ldquo;whereas
there are ten times more adventures to be met with in England than in
Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany to boot.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the
old England before railways, though Mr. Petulengro heard a man speaking
of a wonderful invention that &ldquo;would set aside all the old roads,
which in a little time would be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and
cause all England to be laid down with iron roads, on which people would
go thundering along in vehicles, pushed forward by fire and smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow makes another of his characters also foretell the triumph of
railways, and I insist on quoting part of the sentence as another example
of Borrow&rsquo;s mysterious way: the speaker has had his information
from the projector of the scheme: &ldquo;which he has told me many of
the wisest heads of England have been dreaming of during a period of
six hundred years, and which it seems was alluded to by a certain Brazen
Head in the story-book of Friar Bacon, who is generally supposed to
have been a wizard, but in reality was a great philosopher.&nbsp; Young
man, in less than twenty years, by which time I shall be dead and gone,
England will be surrounded with roads of metal, on which armies may
travel with mighty velocity, and of which the walls of brass and iron
by which the friar proposed to defend his native land are types.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet he makes little of the practical difference between the England
of railways and <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the
England of coaches; in fact he hated the bullying coachmen so that he
expressed nothing but gladness when they had disappeared from the road.&nbsp;
No: it was first as the England of the successful wars with Napoleon,
and second as the England of his youth that he idealised it&mdash;the
country of Byron and Farmer George, not that of Tennyson, Victoria and
Albert; for as Byron was one of the new age and yet looked back to Pope
and down on Wordsworth, so did Borrow look back.</p>
<p>His English geography is far vaguer than his Spanish.&nbsp; He creeps&mdash;walking
or riding&mdash;over this land with more mystery.&nbsp; The variety
and difficulties of the roads were less, and actual movement fills very
few pages.&nbsp; He advances not so much step by step as adventure by
adventure.&nbsp; Well might he say, a little impudently, &ldquo;there
is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of adventures,
with the exception of the present one, and this is not yet terminated&rdquo;&mdash;it
ends with a fall from his horse which stuns him.&nbsp; There is an air
of somnambulism about some of the travel, especially when he is escaping
alone from London and hack-writing.&nbsp; He shows great art in his
transitions from day to day, from scene to scene, making it natural
that one hour of one day should have the importance of the whole of
another year, and one house more than the importance of several day&rsquo;s
journeys.&nbsp; It matters not that he crammed more than was possible
between Greenwich and Horncastle fairs, probably by transplanting earlier
or later events.&nbsp; Time and space submit to him: his old schoolfellows
were vainly astonished that he gave no chapters to them and his years
at Norwich Grammar School.&nbsp; Thus England seems a great and a strange
land on Borrow&rsquo;s page, though he does not touch the sea or the
mountains, or any celebrated places except Stonehenge.&nbsp; His England
is strange, I think, because it is presented according to a purely spiritual
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>geography
in which the childish drawling of &ldquo;Witney on the Windrush manufactures
blankets,&rdquo; etc., is utterly forgot.&nbsp; Few men have the courage
or the power to be honestly impressionistic and to say what they feel
instead of compromising between that and what they believe to be &ldquo;the
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also strange on account of the many adventures which it provides,
and these will always attract attention, because England in 1911 is
not what it was in 1825, but still more because few men, especially
writing men, ever take their chance upon the roads of England for a
few months together.&nbsp; At the same time it must be granted that
Borrow had a morbid fear of being dull or at least of being ordinary.&nbsp;
He was a partly conscious provider of entertainment when he made the
book so thick with incidents, scenes and portraits, and each incident,
scene and portrait so perfect after its kind.&nbsp; Where he overdoes
his emphasis or refinement, can only be decided by differing tastes.&nbsp;
Some, for example, cannot abide his description of the sleepless man
who had at last discovered a perfect opiate in Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp;
I find myself stopping short at the effect of sherry and Popish leanings
on the publican and his trade, and still more the effect of his return
to ale and commonsense religion: how everyone bought his liquids and
paid for them and wanted to treat him, while the folk of his parish
had already made him a churchwarden.&nbsp; This might have been writ
sarcastic by a witty Papist.</p>
<p>Probably Borrow used the device of recognition and reappearances
to satisfy a rather primitive taste in fiction, and to add to the mystery,
though I will again suggest that a man who travelled and went about
among men as he did would take less offence at these things.&nbsp; The
re-appearances of Jasper are natural enough, except at the ford when
Borrow is about to pass into Wales: those of Ardry <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>less
so.&nbsp; But when Borrow contrives to hear more of the old china collector
and of Isopel also from the jockey, and shuffles about the postillion,
Murtagh, the Man in Black, and Platitude, and introduces Sir John Bowring
for punishment, he makes &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; much inferior
to &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These devices never succeed, except where their extravagance makes
us laugh heartily&mdash;as when on Salisbury Plain he meets returning
from Botany Bay the long lost son of his old London Bridge apple-woman.&nbsp;
The devices are unnecessary and remain as stiffening stains upon a book
that is otherwise full of nature and human nature.</p>
<h2><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>CHAPTER
XXV&mdash;&ldquo;LAVENGRO&rdquo; AND &ldquo;THE ROMANY RYE&rdquo;: THE
CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>As the atmosphere of the two autobiographical books is more intense
and pure than that of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; so the characters
in it are more elaborate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; contained
brilliant sketches and suggestions of men and women.&nbsp; In the autobiography
even the sketches are intimate, like that of the &ldquo;Anglo-Germanist,&rdquo;
William Taylor; and they are not less surprising than the Spanish sketches,
from the Rommany chal who &ldquo;fought in the old Roman fashion.&nbsp;
He bit, he kicked, and screamed like a wild cat of Benygant; casting
foam from his mouth, and fire from his eyes&rdquo;&mdash;from this man
upwards and downwards.&nbsp; Some are highly finished, and these are
not always the best.&nbsp; For example, the portrait of his father,
the stiff, kindly, uncomprehending soldier, strikes me as a little too
much &ldquo;done to a turn.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a little too like a man
in a book, and so perfectly consistent, except for that one picturesque
weakness&mdash;the battle with Big Ben, whose skin was like a toad.&nbsp;
Borrow probably saw and cared very little for his father, and therefore
found it too easy to idealise and produce a mere type, chiefly out of
his head.&nbsp; His mother is more certainly from life, and he could
not detach himself from her sufficiently to make her clear; yet he makes
her his own mother plainly enough.&nbsp; His brother has something of
the same unreality and perfection as his father.&nbsp; These members
of his family belong to one distinct class of studies which includes
among others the <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>publisher,
Sir Richard Phillips.&nbsp; They are of persons not quite of his world
whom he presents to us with admiration, or, on the other hand, with
dislike, but in either case without sympathy.&nbsp; They do not contribute
much to the special character of the autobiography, except in humour.&nbsp;
The interviews with Sir Richard Phillips, in particular, give an example
of Borrow&rsquo;s obviously personal satire, poisonous and yet without
rancour.&nbsp; He is a type.&nbsp; He is the charlatan, holy and massive
and not perfectly self-convincing.&nbsp; When Borrow&rsquo;s money was
running low and he asked the publisher to pay for some contributions
to a magazine, now deceased:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the publisher, &lsquo;what do you
want the money for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Merely to live on,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;it is very
difficult to live in this town without money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much money did you bring with you to town?&rsquo;
demanded the publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some twenty or thirty pounds,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you have spent it already?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;not entirely; but it is fast
disappearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the publisher, &lsquo;I believe you
to be extravagant; yes, sir, extravagant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On what grounds do you suppose me to be so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the publisher, &lsquo;you eat meat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I eat meat sometimes; what
should I eat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bread, sir,&rsquo; said the publisher; &lsquo;bread
and cheese.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So I do, sir, when I am disposed to indulge; but I
cannot often afford it&mdash;it is very expensive to dine on bread and
cheese, especially when one is fond of cheese, as I am.&nbsp; My last
bread and cheese dinner cost me fourteen pence.&nbsp; There is drink,
sir; with bread and cheese one must drink porter, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, sir, eat bread&mdash;bread alone.&nbsp; As good
men as yourself have eaten bread alone; they have been glad to <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>get
it, sir.&nbsp; If with bread and cheese you must drink porter, sir,
with bread alone you can, perhaps, drink water, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I got paid at last for my writings in the review,
not, it is true, in the current coin of the realm, but in certain bills;
there were two of them, one payable at twelve, and the other at eighteen
months after date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident serves to diversify the narrative, and may be taken
from his own London experiences, while the particular merriment of the
rhyme is Borrow&rsquo;s; but it is not of the essence of the book, and
fits only indifferently into the mysterious &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo;
London, the city of the gallant Ardry and the old apple-woman who called
him &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and called Moll Flanders &ldquo;blessed Mary
Flanders.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Richard will not mysteriously re-appear,
nor will Captain and Mrs. Borrow.&nbsp; I should say, in fact, that
characters of this class have scarcely at all the power of motion.&nbsp;
What is more, they take us not only a little way out of Borrow&rsquo;s
world sometimes, but away from Borrow himself.</p>
<p>Apart from these characters, the men and women of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; are all in harmony with one another,
with Borrow, and with Borrow&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; Jasper Petulengro
and his wife, his sister Ursula, the gigantic Tawno Chikno, the witch
Mrs. Herne, and the evil sprite Leonora, Thurtell, the fighting men,
the Irish outlaw Jerry Grant, who was suspected of raising a storm by
&ldquo;something Irish and supernatural&rdquo; to win a fight, Murtagh,
that wicked innocent, the old apple-woman, Blazing Bosville, Isopel
Berners, the jockey who drove one hundred and ten miles in eleven hours
to see &ldquo;the only friend he ever had in the world,&rdquo; John
Thurtell, and say, &ldquo;God Almighty bless you, Jack!&rdquo; before
the drop fell, the old gentleman who had learned &ldquo;Sergeant Broughton&rsquo;s
guard&rdquo; and knocked out the bullying coachman, the Welsh preacher
and his wife, the Arcadian old bee-keeper, the <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>rat-catcher&mdash;all
these and their companions are woven into one piece by the genius of
their creator, Borrow.&nbsp; I can imagine them all greeting him together
as the Gypsies did, and much as the jockey did afterwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here the Gipsy gemman see,<br />
With his Roman jib and his rome and dree&mdash;<br />
Rome and dree, rum and dry<br />
Rally round the Rommany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He waves his wand and they disappear.&nbsp; He made them as Jerry
Grant made the storm and beat Sergeant Bagg.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
he actually does raise such a storm, though Knapp affected to discover
it in a newspaper of the period.&nbsp; Sampson and Martin are fighting
at North Walsham, and a storm comes on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s wind and dust, a crash, rain and hail; is it
possible to fight amidst such a commotion?&nbsp; Yes! the fight goes
on; again the boy strikes the man full on the brow, but it is no use
striking that man, his frame is of adamant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Boy, thy strength
is beginning to give way, thou art becoming confused&rsquo;; the man
now goes to work, amidst rain and hail.&nbsp; &lsquo;Boy, thou wilt
not hold out ten minutes longer against rain, hail, and the blows of
such an antagonist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the storm was at its height; the black thundercloud
had broken into many, which assumed the wildest shapes and the strangest
colours, some of them unspeakably glorious; the rain poured in a deluge,
and more than one water-spout was seen at no great distance: an immense
rabble is hurrying in one direction; a multitude of men of all ranks,
peers and yokels, prize-fighters and Jews, and the last came to plunder,
and are now plundering amidst that wild confusion of hail and rain,
men and horses, carts and carriages.&nbsp; But all hurry in one direction,
through mud and mire; there&rsquo;s a town only three miles distant
which is soon reached, and soon filled, it will not contain one-third
<!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>of
that mighty rabble; but there&rsquo;s another town farther on&mdash;the
good old city is farther on, only twelve miles; what&rsquo;s that! who&rsquo;ll
stay here? onward to the old town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry skurry, a mixed multitude of men and horses, carts and
carriages, all in the direction of the old town; and, in the midst of
all that mad throng, at a moment when the rain gushes were coming down
with particular fury, and the artillery of the sky was pealing as I
had never heard it peal before, I felt some one seize me by the arm&mdash;I
turned round and beheld Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you, Mr. Petulengro,&rsquo; said
I; for the thunder drowned the words which he appeared to be uttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dearginni,&rsquo; I heard Mr. Petulengro say, &lsquo;it
thundereth.&nbsp; I was asking, brother, whether you believe in dukkeripens?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not, Mr. Petulengro; but this is strange weather
to be asking me whether I believe in fortunes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Grondinni,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;it haileth.&nbsp;
I believe in dukkeripens, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who has more right,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;seeing
that you live by them?&nbsp; But this tempest is truly horrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dearginni, grondinni ta villaminni!&nbsp; It thundereth,
it haileth, and also flameth,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look
up there, brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked up.&nbsp; Connected with this tempest there was one
feature to which I have already alluded&mdash;the wonderful colours
of the clouds.&nbsp; Some were of vivid green; others of the brightest
orange; others as black as pitch.&nbsp; The Gypsy&rsquo;s finger was
pointed to a particular part of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you see there, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A strange kind of cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What does it look like, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Something like a stream of blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A bloody fortune!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;And whom
may it betide?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who
knows?&rsquo; said the Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the way, dashing and splashing, and scattering man, horse,
and cart to the left and right, came an open barouche, drawn by four
smoking steeds, with postillions in scarlet jackets, and leather skull-caps.&nbsp;
Two forms were conspicuous in it; that of the successful bruiser, and
of his friend and backer, the sporting gentleman of my acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His!&rsquo; said the Gypsy, pointing to the latter,
whose stern features wore a smile of triumph, as, probably recognizing
me in the crowd, he nodded in the direction of where I stood, as the
barouche hurried by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There went the barouche, dashing through the rain gushes&rsquo;,
and in it one whose boast it was that he was equal to &lsquo;either
fortune.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many have heard of that man&mdash;many may be
desirous of knowing yet more of him.&nbsp; I have nothing to do with
that man&rsquo;s after life&mdash;he fulfilled his dukkeripen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A bad, violent man!&rsquo;&nbsp; Softly, friend; when thou wouldst
speak harshly of the dead, remember that thou hast not yet fulfilled
thy own dukkeripen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Borrow fits these pugilists into the texture of his autobiography,
so he does men who appear not once but a dozen times.&nbsp; Take Jasper
Petulengro out of the books and he does not amount to much.&nbsp; In
them he is a figure of most masculine beauty, a king, a trickster, and
thief, but simple, good with his fists, loving life, manly sport and
fair play.&nbsp; He and Borrow meet and shake hands as &ldquo;brothers&rdquo;
when they are little boys.&nbsp; They meet again, by chance, as big
boys, and Jasper says: &ldquo;Your blood beat when mine was near, as
mine always does at the coming of a brother; and we became brothers
in that lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper laughs at the Sapengro and Lavengro
and horse-witch because he lacks two things, &ldquo;mother sense and
gentle Rommany,&rdquo; and he has something to do with teaching Borrow
the Gypsy tongue and Gypsy ways, and the &ldquo;mother sense&rdquo;
of shifting <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>for
himself.&nbsp; The Gypsies approve him also as &ldquo;a pure fist master.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In return he teaches Mrs. Chikno&rsquo;s child to say his prayers in
Rommany.&nbsp; They were willing&mdash;all but Mrs. Herne&mdash;that
he should marry Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s sister, Ursula.&nbsp; It is always
by chance that they meet, and chance is very favourable.&nbsp; They
meet at significant times, as when Borrow has been troubled by the preacher
and the state of his own soul, or when he is sick of London and hack-writing
and poverty.&nbsp; In fact, the Gypsies, and his &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
Jasper in particular, returning and returning, are the motive of the
book.&nbsp; They connect Borrow with what is strange, with what is simple,
and with what is free.&nbsp; The very last words of &ldquo;The Romany
Rye,&rdquo; spoken as he is walking eastward, are &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally from India.&nbsp;
I think I&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are not a device.&nbsp;
The re-appearances of these wandering men are for the most part only
pleasantly unexpected.&nbsp; Their mystery is the mystery of nature
and life.&nbsp; They keep their language and their tents against the
mass of civilization and length of time.&nbsp; They are foreigners but
as native as the birds.&nbsp; It is Borrow&rsquo;s triumph to make them
as romantic as their reputation while yet satisfying Gypsy students
as to his facts.</p>
<p>Jasper is almost like a second self, a kind of more simple, atavistic
self, to Borrow, as in that characteristic picture, where he is drawing
near to Wales with his friends, the Welsh preacher and his wife.&nbsp;
A brook is the border and they point it out.&nbsp; There is a horseman
entering it: &ldquo;he stops in the middle of it as if to water his
steed.&rdquo;&nbsp; They ask Lavengro if he will come with them into
Wales.&nbsp; They persuade him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not go with you,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dost
thou see that man in the ford?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is staring at us so, and whose horse has not yet
done drinking?&nbsp; Of course I see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I
shall turn back with him.&nbsp; God bless you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go back with him not,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;he
is one of those whom I like not, one of the clibberty-clabber, as Master
Ellis Wyn observes&mdash;turn not with that man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go not back with him,&rsquo; said Winifred.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
thou goest with that man, thou wilt soon forget all our profitable counsels;
come with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot; I have much to say to him.&nbsp; Kosko Divous,
Mr. Petulengro.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kosko Divvus, Pal,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, riding
through the water; &lsquo;are you turning back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned back with Mr. Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time Jasper twists about like a weasel bewitching a bird,
and in so doing puts &pound;50 unnoticed into Lavengro&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp;
Lavengro is indignant at the pleasantry.&nbsp; But Jasper insists; the
money is for him to buy a certain horse; if he will not take the money
and buy the horse there will be a quarrel.&nbsp; He has made the money
by fair fighting in the ring, has nowhere to put it, and seriously thinks
that it were best invested in this fine horse, which accordingly Borrow
purchases and takes across England, and sells at Horncastle Fair for
&pound;150.&nbsp; The next scene shows Tawno Chikno at his best.&nbsp;
Borrow has been trotting the horse and racing it against a cob, amid
a company that put him &ldquo;wonderfully in mind of the ancient horse-races
of the heathen north,&rdquo; so that he almost thought himself Gunnar
of Lithend.&nbsp; But Tawno was the man to try the horse at a jump,
said Jasper.&nbsp; Tawno weighed sixteen stone, and the owner thought
him more likely to break the horse&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; Jasper became
very much excited, and offered to forfeit a handful of guineas if harm
was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the man.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the horse-leaper
of the world. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; Tawno, at a bound, leaped into the
saddle, where he really looked like Gunnar of Hlitharend, save <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and
except that the complexion of Gunnar was florid, whereas that of Tawno
was of nearly Mulatto darkness; and that all Tawno&rsquo;s features
were cast in the Grecian model, whereas Gunnar had a snub nose.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a leaping-bar behind the house,&rsquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leaping-bar!&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, scornfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you think my black pal ever rides at a leaping bar?&nbsp;
No more than at a windle-straw.&nbsp; Leap over that meadow wall, Tawno.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Just past the house, in the direction in which I had been trotting,
was a wall about four feet high, beyond which was a small meadow.&nbsp;
Tawno rode the horse gently up to the wall, permitted him to look over,
then backed him for about ten yards, and pressing his calves against
the horse&rsquo;s sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse launching
forward, took the leap in gallant style.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well done, man
and horse!&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;now come back, Tawno.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The leap from the side of the meadow was, however, somewhat higher;
and the horse, when pushed at it, at first turned away; whereupon Tawno
backed him to a greater distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop,
giving a wild cry; whereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly
grazing one of his legs against it.&nbsp; &lsquo;A near thing,&rsquo;
said the landlord, &lsquo;but a good leap.&nbsp; Now, no more leaping,
so long as I have control over the animal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very different beautiful scene is where Mrs. Petulengro braids
Isopel&rsquo;s fair hair in Gypsy fashion, half against her will, and
Lavengro looks on, showing Isopel at a glance his disapproval of the
fashion, while Petulengro admires it.&nbsp; If it is not too much to
quote, I will do so, because it is the clearest and most detailed picture
of more than one figure in the whole of the autobiography.&nbsp; Mr.
and Mrs. Petulengro have come to visit Isopel, and Lavengro has fetched
her to his tent, where they are awaiting her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Belle and I advanced towards our guests.&nbsp; As we drew
nigh Mr. Petulengro took off his hat and made a <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>profound
obeisance to Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro rose from her stool and made
a profound curtsey.&nbsp; Belle, who had flung her hair back over her
shoulders, returned their salutations by bending her head, and after
slightly glancing at Mr. Petulengro, fixed her large blue eyes full
upon his wife.&nbsp; Both these females were very handsome&mdash;but
how unlike!&nbsp; Belle fair, with blue eyes and flaxen hair; Mrs. Petulengro
with olive complexion, eyes black, and hair dark&mdash;as dark could
be.&nbsp; Belle, in demeanour calm and proud; the Gypsy graceful, but
full of movement and agitation.&nbsp; And then how different were those
two in stature!&nbsp; The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely ascended
to the breast of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I could see that Mrs. Petulengro
gazed on Belle with unmixed admiration: so did her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said the latter, &lsquo;one thing I will say, which is, that there is
only one on earth worthy to stand up in front of this she, and that
is the beauty of the world, as far as man flesh is concerned, Tawno
Chikno; what a pity he did not come down! . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Petulengro says: &lsquo;You are very beautiful, madam,
though you are not dressed as I could wish to see you, and your hair
is hanging down in sad confusion; allow me to assist you in arranging
your hair, madam; I will dress it for you in our fashion; I would fain
see how your hair would look in our poor Gypsy fashion; pray allow me,
madam?&rsquo; and she took Belle by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I really can do no such thing,&rsquo; said Belle, withdrawing
her hand; &lsquo;I thank you for coming to see me, but . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro; &lsquo;I should esteem your allowing me a great
mark of condescension.&nbsp; You are very beautiful, madam, and I think
you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have a great esteem for persons
with fair complexions and hair; I have a less regard for people with
dark hair and complexions, madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then
why did you turn off the lord, and take up with me?&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &lsquo;that same lord was fair enough all about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;People do when they are young and silly what they sometimes
repent of when they are of riper years and understandings.&nbsp; I sometimes
think that had I not been something of a simpleton, I might at this
time be a great court lady.&nbsp; Now, madam,&rsquo; said she, again
taking Belle by the hand, &lsquo;do oblige me by allowing me to plait
your hair a little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have really a good mind to be angry with you,&rsquo;
said Belle, giving Mrs. Petulengro a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do allow her to arrange your hair,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;she
means no harm, and wishes to do you honour; do oblige her and me too,
for I should like to see how your hair would look dressed in her fashion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You hear what the young rye says?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure you will oblige the young rye, if
not myself.&nbsp; Many people would be willing to oblige the young rye,
if he would but ask them; but he is not in the habit of asking favours.&nbsp;
He has a nose of his own, which he keeps tolerably exalted; he does
not think small-beer of himself, madam; and all the time I have been
with him, I never heard him ask a favour before; therefore, madam, I
am sure you will oblige him.&rsquo;&nbsp; . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men talk together, Jasper telling about the passing of the &ldquo;old-fashioned
good-tempered constables,&rdquo; the advent of railways, and the spoiling
of road life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . &lsquo;Now, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;I
have braided your hair in our fashion: you look very beautiful, madam;
more beautiful, if possible, than before.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle now rose,
and came forward with her tire-woman.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro was loud
in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did not think Belle was improved
in appearance by having submitted to the ministry of Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s
<!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>hand.&nbsp;
Nature never intended Belle to appear as a Gypsy; she had made her too
proud and serious.&nbsp; A more proper part for her was that of a heroine,
a queenly heroine,&mdash;that of Theresa of Hungary, for example; or,
better still, that of Brynhilda the Valkyrie, the beloved of Sigurd,
the serpent-killer, who incurred the curse of Odin, because, in the
tumult of spears, she sided with the young king, and doomed the old
warrior to die, to whom Odin had promised victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle looked at me for a moment in silence; then turning to
Mrs. Petulengro, she said, &lsquo;You have had your will with me; are
you satisfied?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Quite so, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro, &lsquo;and I hope you will be so too, as soon as you have
looked in the glass.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have looked in one already,&rsquo;
said Belle,&rsquo; and the glass does not flatter.&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here it is easy to notice how the uncolloquial and even ugly English
does not destroy the illusion of the scene, but entirely subserves it
and makes these two or three pages fine painter&rsquo;s work for richness
and still drama.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten the Man in Black, though I gladly would.&nbsp;
Not that I am any more in sympathy with his theology than Borrow&rsquo;s,
if it is more interesting and venerable.&nbsp; But in this priest, Borrow&rsquo;s
method, always instinctively intense if not exaggerated, falls to caricature.&nbsp;
I have no objection to caricature; when it is of a logical or incidental
kind I enjoy it, even in &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;; I enjoy, for
example, the snoring Wordsworthian, without any prejudice against Wordsworth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Catholic Times&rdquo; as late as 1900 was still angry with
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;crass anti-Catholic bigotry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should
have expected them to laugh consumedly at a priest, a parson and a publican
who deserve places in the same gallery with wicked earls and noble savages
of popular fiction.&nbsp; It may be true that this &ldquo;creation of
Borrow&rsquo;s most studied hatred&rdquo; is, as Mr. Seccombe says,
<a name="citation242"></a><a href="#footnote242">{242}</a> &ldquo;a
triumph <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>of
complex characterisation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is &ldquo;a joyous liver and
an unscrupulous libertine, sceptical as Voltaire, as atheistic as a
German professor, as practical as a Jew banker, as subtle as a Jesuit,
he has as many ways of converting the folks among whom he is thrown
as Panurge had of eating the corn in ear.&nbsp; For the simple and credulous&mdash;crosses
and beads; for the hard-hearted and venal&mdash;material considerations;
for the cultured and educated&mdash;a fine tissue of epigrams and anthropology;
for the ladies&mdash;flattery and badinage.&nbsp; A spiritual ancestor
of Anatole France&rsquo;s marvellous full-length figure of Jer&ocirc;me
Coignard, Borrow&rsquo;s conception takes us back first to Rabelais
and secondly to the seventeenth-century conviction of the profound Machiavellism
of Jesuitry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; he
is an intruder with a design of turning these books into tracts.&nbsp;
He is treated far more elaborately than any other character except the
author&rsquo;s, and with a massive man&rsquo;s striving after subtlety.&nbsp;
Moreover, Borrow has made it impossible to ignore him or to cut him
out, by interlacing him with every other character in these two books.&nbsp;
With sad persistency and na&iuml;ve ingenuity he brings it about that
every one shall see, or have seen in the past, this terrible priest.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s natural way of dealing with such a man would be that
of the converted pugilist who, on hearing of an atheist in the vicinity,
wanted to go and &ldquo;knock the beggar down for Jesus&rsquo; sake&rdquo;;
and a variation upon this would have been delightful and in harmony
with the rest of the book.&nbsp; But clever as the priest is, Borrow
himself is stronger, honester and cleverer, too.&nbsp; Of course, the
priest leads him to some good things.&nbsp; Above all, he leads to the
incident of the half-converted publican, who is being ruined by sherry
and Popery.&nbsp; Borrow pursuades him to take ale, which gives him
the courage to give up thoughts of conversion, and to <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>turn
on his enemies and re-establish himself, to make a good business, become
a churchwarden, and teach boxing to the brewer&rsquo;s sons, because
it is &ldquo;a fine manly English art and a great defence against Popery.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is at least a greater defence than Borrow&rsquo;s pen, or deserves
to be.</p>

XXVI&mdash;&ldquo;LAVENGRO&rdquo; AND &ldquo;THE ROMANY RYE&rdquo;:
THE STYLE</h2>
<p>The writing of the autobiography differs from that of &ldquo;The
Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is less flowing and more laboured.&nbsp;
It has less movement and buoyancy, but more delicacy and variety.&nbsp;
It is a finer and more intimate style, which over and over again distinguishes
Borrow from the Victorian pure and simple.&nbsp; The dialogue is finer;
it is used less to disguise or vary narrative, and more to reveal character
and make dramatic effect; and it is even lyrical at times.&nbsp; Borrow
can be Victorian still.&nbsp; This example is from the old man&rsquo;s
history in &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother had died about three years previously.&nbsp; I felt
the death of my mother keenly, but that of my father less than was my
duty; indeed, truth compels me to acknowledge that I scarcely regretted
his death.&nbsp; The cause of this want of proper filial feeling was
the opposition which I had experienced from him in an affair which deeply
concerned me.&nbsp; I had formed an attachment for a young female in
the neighbourhood, who, though poor, was of highly respectable birth,
her father having been a curate of the Established Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This better one is from &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Francis Ardry proceeded to make me his confidant.&nbsp;
It appeared that he had had the good fortune to make the acquaintance
of the most delightful young Frenchwoman imaginable, Annette La Noire
by name, who had just arrived from her native country with the intention
<!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>of
obtaining the situation of governess in some English family; a position
which, on account of her many accomplishments, she was eminently qualified
to fill.&nbsp; Francis Ardry had, however, persuaded her to relinquish
her intention for the present, on the ground that, until she had become
acclimated in England, her health would probably suffer from the confinement
inseparable from the occupation in which she was desirous of engaging;
he had, moreover&mdash;for it appeared that she was the most frank and
confiding creature in the world&mdash;succeeded in persuading her to
permit him to hire for her a very handsome first floor in his own neighbourhood,
and to accept a few inconsiderable presents in money and jewellery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But coarse and rigid as this is the same vocabulary, the same ample,
oratorical tone, will help Borrow to genial, substantial effects such
as the dinner with the landlord and the commercial traveller: &ldquo;The
dinner was good, though plain, consisting of boiled mackerel&mdash;rather
a rarity in those parts at that time&mdash;with fennel sauce, a prime
baron of roast beef after the mackerel, then a tart and noble Cheshire
cheese; we had prime sherry at dinner, and whilst eating the cheese
prime porter, that of Barclay, the only good porter in the world.&nbsp;
After the cloth was removed we had a bottle of very good port; and whilst
partaking of the port I had an argument with the commercial traveller
on the subject of the corn-laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is more, this is the vocabulary and tone of the whole book,
and how far the total effect is from coarseness and rigidity I cannot
show now if I have not done so already.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s gusto triumphs
over this style in descriptions of men riding, fighting, talking or
drinking.&nbsp; His sense of mystery triumphs over it continually as
the prevailing atmosphere must prove.&nbsp; The gusto and the mystery
are all the more impressive because the means are entirely concealed,
except when the writer draws himself <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>up
for an apostrophe, and that is not much too often nor always tedious.&nbsp;
The style is capable of essential simplicity, though not of refined
simplicity, just as a man with a hard hat, black clothes and a malacca
cane may be a good deal simpler and more at home with natural things
than a hairy hygienic gentleman.&nbsp; I will quote one example&mdash;the
old bee-keeper in &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice,
and said that as he did not live far off, he hoped that I would go with
him and taste some of his mead.&nbsp; As I had never tasted mead, of
which I had frequently read in the compositions of the Welsh bards,
and, moreover, felt rather thirsty from the heat of the day, I told
him that I should have great pleasure in attending him.&nbsp; Whereupon,
turning off together, we proceeded about half a mile, sometimes between
stone walls, and at other times hedges, till we reached a small hamlet,
through which we passed, and presently came to a very pretty cottage,
delightfully situated within a garden, surrounded by a hedge of woodbines.&nbsp;
Opening a gate at one corner of the garden, he led the way to a large
shed which stood partly behind the cottage, which he said was his stable;
thereupon he dismounted and led his donkey into the shed, which was
without stalls, but had a long rack and manger.&nbsp; On one side he
tied his donkey, after taking off her caparisons, and I followed his
example, tying my horse at the other side with a rope halter which he
gave me; he then asked me to come in and taste his mead, but I told
him that I must attend to the comfort of my horse first, and forthwith,
taking a wisp of straw, rubbed him carefully down.&nbsp; Then taking
a pailful of clear water which stood in the shed, I allowed the horse
to drink about half a pint; and then turning to the old man, who all
the time had stood by looking at my proceedings, I asked him whether
he had any oats?&nbsp; &lsquo;I have all kinds of grain,&rsquo; he replied;
and, going <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>out,
he presently returned with two measures, one a large and the other a
small one, both filled with oats, mixed with a few beans, and handing
the large one to me for the horse, he emptied the other before the donkey,
who, before she began to despatch it, turned her nose to her master&rsquo;s
face and fairly kissed him.&nbsp; Having given my horse his portion,
I told the old man that I was ready to taste his mead as soon as he
pleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage, where, making me
sit down by a deal table in a neatly-sanded kitchen, he produced from
an old-fashioned closet a bottle, holding about a quart, and a couple
of cups, which might each contain about half a pint, then opening the
bottle and filling the cups with a brown-coloured liquor, he handed
one to me, and taking a seat opposite to me, he lifted the other, nodded,
and saying to me&mdash;&lsquo;Health and welcome,&rsquo; placed it to
his lips and drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Health and thanks,&rsquo; I replied; and being very
thirsty, emptied my cup at a draught; I had scarcely done so, however,
when I half repented.&nbsp; The mead was deliciously sweet and mellow,
but appeared strong as brandy; my eyes reeled in my head, and my brain
became slightly dizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mead is a strong drink,&rsquo; said
the old man, as he looked at me, with a half smile on his countenance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is, at any rate,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;so strong, indeed,
that I would not drink another cup for any consideration.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I would not ask you,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;for,
if you did, you would most probably be stupid all day, and wake next
morning with a headache.&nbsp; Mead is a good drink, but woundily strong,
especially to those who be not used to it, as I suppose you are not.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where do you get it?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I make it myself,&rsquo;
said the old man, &lsquo;from the honey which my bees make.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you many bees?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;A great many,&rsquo;
said the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;And do you keep them,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;for the sake of making mead with their honey?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
keep them,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;partly because I am fond of them,
and <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>partly
for what they bring me in; they make me a great deal of honey, some
of which I sell, and with a little I make me some mead to warm my poor
heart with, or occasionally to treat a friend with like yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And do you support yourself entirely by means of your bees?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;I have a little bit of ground
behind my house, which is my principal means of support.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And do you live alone?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I live quite alone.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And have you always lived alone?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man emptied
his cup, and his heart being warmed with the mead, he told me his history,
which was simplicity itself.&nbsp; His father was a small yeoman, who,
at his death, had left him, his only child, the cottage, with a small
piece of ground behind it, and on this little property he had lived
ever since.&nbsp; About the age of twenty-five he had married an industrious
young woman, by whom he had one daughter, who died before reaching years
of womanhood.&nbsp; His wife, however, had survived her daughter many
years, and had been a great comfort to him, assisting him in his rural
occupations; but, about four years before the present period, he had
lost her, since which time he had lived alone, making himself as comfortable
as he could; cultivating his ground, with the help of a lad from the
neighbouring village, attending to his bees, and occasionally riding
his donkey to market, and hearing the word of God, which he said he
was sorry he could not read, twice a week regularly at the parish church.&nbsp;
Such was the old man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house,
and showed me his little domain.&nbsp; It consisted of about two acres
in admirable cultivation; a small portion of it formed a kitchen garden,
while the rest was sown with four kinds of grain, wheat, barley, pease,
and beans.&nbsp; The air was full of ambrosial sweets, resembling those
proceeding from an orange grove; a place, which though I had <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>never
seen at that time, I since have.&nbsp; In the garden was the habitation
of the bees, a long box, supported upon three oaken stumps.&nbsp; It
was full of small round glass windows, and appeared to be divided into
a great many compartments, much resembling drawers placed sideways.&nbsp;
He told me that, as one compartment was filled, the bees left it for
another; so that, whenever he wanted honey, he could procure some without
injuring the insects.&nbsp; Through the little round windows I could
see several of the bees at work; hundreds were going in and out of the
doors; hundreds were buzzing about on the flowers, the woodbines, and
beans.&nbsp; As I looked around on the well-cultivated field, the garden,
and the bees, I thought I had never before seen so rural and peaceful
a scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be said of this that it is the style of the time, modified
inexplicably at almost every point by the writer&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;
The Bible and the older-fashioned narrative English of Defoe and Smollett
have obviously lent it some phrases, and also a nakedness and directness
that is half disdainful of the emotions and colours which it cannot
hide.&nbsp; Still further to qualify the Victorianism which he was heir
to, Borrow took over something from the insinuating Sterne.&nbsp; Mr.
Thomas Seccombe <a name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250">{250}</a>
has noticed Sterne particularly in Borrow&rsquo;s picture of his father,
one of the most deliberate and artificial portions of the book:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ironical humour blent with pathos in his picture of this
ill-rewarded old disciplinarian (who combined a tenderness of heart
with a fondness for military metaphor that frequently reminds one of
&lsquo;My Uncle Toby&rsquo;), the details of the ailments and the portents
that attended his infantile career, and, above all, the glimpses of
the wandering military life from barrack to barrack and from garrison
to garrison, inevitably remind the reader of the childish <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>reminiscences
of Laurence Sterne, a writer to whom it may thus early be said that
George Borrow paid no small amount of unconscious homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same critic has remarked on &ldquo;the Sterne-like conclusion
of a chapter: &lsquo;Italy&mdash;what was I going to say about Italy?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was perhaps Sterne who taught him the use of the dash when no more
words are necessary or ready to meet the case, and also when no more
are permissible by contemporary taste.&nbsp; The passage where Ardry
and his French mistress talk to Borrow, she using her own language,
is like &ldquo;The Sentimental Journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as Mr. Seccombe
has suggested, Borrow found in Sterne&rsquo;s a precedent for the rate
of progress in his autobiography.</p>
<p>But innumerable are the possible styles which combine something from
the Bible, Defoe, and Sterne, with something else upon a Victorian foundation.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s something else, which dominates and welds the rest, is
the most important.&nbsp; It expresses the man, or rather it allows
the man&rsquo;s qualities to appear, his melancholy, his independence,
his curiosity, his love of strong men and horses.&nbsp; Of little felicities
there are very few.&nbsp; It has gusto always at command, and mystery
also.&nbsp; We feel in it a kind of reality not often associated with
professional literature, but rather with the letters of men who are
not writers and with the speech of illiterate men of character.&nbsp;
The great difference between them and Borrow is that their speech can
rarely be represented in print except by another genius, and that their
letters only now and then reach the level which Borrow continues at
and often rises above.&nbsp; Yet he has something in common with such
men&mdash;for example, in his feeling for Nature.&nbsp; In Spain, it
is true, he gave way to declamatory descriptions of grandeur and desolation:
in England, where he saw nothing of the kind, he wrote little description,
and the impression of the country through which he is passing is that
of an inarticulate outdoor man, <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>strong
and sincere but vague.&nbsp; Here, again, he has something in common
with the eighteenth-century man, who liked the country, but would probably
agree that one green field was like another.&nbsp; He writes like the
man who desired a gentle wife, an Arabic book, the haunch of a buck,
and Madeira old.&nbsp; He reminds us of an even older or simpler type
when he apostrophises the retired pugilist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a treat to see thee, Tom of Bedford, in thy &lsquo;public&rsquo;
in Holborn way, whither thou hast retired with thy well-earned bays.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis Friday night, and nine by Holborn clock.&nbsp; There sits
the yeoman at the end of his long room, surrounded by his friends: glasses
are filled, and a song is the cry, and a song is sung well suited to
the place; it finds an echo in every heart&mdash;fists are clenched,
arms are waved, and the portraits of the mightly fighting men of yore,
Broughton, and Slack, and Ben, which adorn the walls, appear to smile
grim approbation, whilst many a manly voice joins in the bold chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a health to old honest John Bull,<br />
When he&rsquo;s gone we shan&rsquo;t find such another,<br />
And with hearts and with glasses brim full,<br />
We will drink to old England, his mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is little doubt of the immortality of this good old style,
and it testifies to the full heart and perhaps the full glass also of
George Borrow; but it was not this passage in particular that made Whitwell
Elwin call his writing &ldquo;almost affectedly simple.&rdquo;</p>

XXVII&mdash;BORROW AND LOW LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; in 1851 and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; in
1857 failed to impress the critics or the public.&nbsp; Men were disappointed
because &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; was &ldquo;not an autobiography.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They said that the adventures did not bear &ldquo;the impress of truth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They suggested that the anti-Papistry was &ldquo;added and interpolated
to suit the occasion of the recent Papal aggression.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
laughed at its mystery-making.&nbsp; They said that it gave &ldquo;a
false dream in the place of reality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ford regretted that
Borrow had &ldquo;told so little about himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two friends
praised it and foretold long life for it.&nbsp; Whitwell Elwin in 1857
said that &ldquo;the truth and vividness of the descriptions both of
scenes and persons, coupled with the purity, force and simplicity of
the language, should confer immortality upon many of its pages.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Saturday Review&rdquo; found that he had humour and romance,
and that his writing left &ldquo;a general impression of the scenery
and persons introduced so strongly vivid and life-like,&rdquo; that
it reminded them of Defoe rather than of any contemporary author; they
called the books a &ldquo;strange cross between a novel and an autobiography.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1857 also, &Eacute;mile Mont&eacute;gut wrote a study of &ldquo;The
Gypsy Gentleman,&rdquo; which he published in his &ldquo;Ecrivains Modernes
de l&rsquo;Angleterre.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said that Borrow had revived
a neglected literary form, not artificially, but as being the natural
frame for the scenes of his wandering life: he even went so far as to
say that the form and manner of the picaresque or rogue novel, like
&ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; is the inevitable one for pictures of the low
and <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>vagabond
life.&nbsp; This form, said he, Borrow adopted not deliberately but
intuitively, because he had a certain attitude to express: he rediscovered
it, as Cervantes and Mendoza invented it, because it was the most appropriate
clothing for his conceptions.&nbsp; Borrow had, without any such ambition,
become the Quevedo and the Mendoza of modern England.</p>
<p>The autobiography resembles the rogue novel in that it is well peppered
with various isolated narratives strung upon the thread of the hero&rsquo;s
experience.&nbsp; It differs chiefly in that the study of the hero is
serious and without roguery.&nbsp; The conscious attempt to make it
as good as a rogue novel on its own ground caused some of the chief
faults of the book, the excess of recognitions and re-appearances, the
postillion&rsquo;s story, and the visits of the Man in Black.</p>
<p>When Borrow came to answer his critics in the Appendix to &ldquo;The
Romany Rye,&rdquo; he assumed that they thought him vulgar for dealing
in Gypsies and the like.&nbsp; He retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rank, wealth, fine clothes and dignified employments, are
no doubt very fine things, but they are merely externals, they do not
make a gentleman, they add external grace and dignity to the gentleman
and scholar, but they make neither; and is it not better to be a gentleman
without them than not a gentleman with them?&nbsp; Is not Lavengro,
when he leaves London on foot with twenty pounds in his pocket, entitled
to more respect than Mr. Flamson flaming in his coach with a million?&nbsp;
And is not even the honest jockey at Horncastle, who offers a fair price
to Lavengro for his horse, entitled to more than the scroundrel lord,
who attempts to cheat him of one-fourth of its value. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have said the books were a long tract to prove that many
waters cannot quench gentlemanliness, or &ldquo;once a gentleman always
a gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a rule, when Borrow gets away from life
and begins to think about it, he ceases to be an individual and becomes
a tame and entirely convenient <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>member
of society, fit for the Commission of the Peace or a berth at the British
Museum.&nbsp; After he has made &pound;20 by pen-slavery and saved himself
from serious poverty, he exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reader, amidst the difficulties and dangers of this life,
should you ever be tempted to despair, call to mind these latter chapters
of the life of Lavengro.&nbsp; There are few positions, however difficult,
from which dogged resolution and perseverance may not liberate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he comes to discuss his own work he says that &ldquo;it represents
him, however, as never forgetting that he is the son of a brave but
poor gentleman, and that if he is a hack author, he is likewise a scholar.&nbsp;
It shows him doing no dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he occasionally
associates with low characters, he does so chiefly to gratify the curiosity
of a scholar.&nbsp; In his conversations with the apple-woman of London
Bridge, the scholar is ever apparent, so again in his acquaintance with
the man of the table, for the book is no raker up of the uncleanness
of London, and if it gives what at first sight appears refuse, it invariably
shows that a pearl of some kind, generally a philological one, is contained
amongst it; it shows its hero always accompanied by his love of independence,
scorning in the greatest poverty to receive favours from anybody, and
describes him finally rescuing himself from peculiarly miserable circumstances
by writing a book, an original book, within a week, even as Johnson
is said to have written his &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; and Beckford his
&lsquo;Vathek,&rsquo; and tells how, leaving London, he betakes himself
to the roads and fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the country it shows him leading a life of roving adventure,
becoming tinker, Gypsy, postillion, ostler; associating with various
kinds of people, chiefly of the lower classes, whose ways and habits
are described; but, though leading this erratic life, we gather from
the book that his habits are neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still
follows <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>to
a certain extent his favourite pursuits, hunting after strange characters,
or analysing strange words and names.&nbsp; At the conclusion of Chapter
XLVII., which terminates the first part of the history, it hints that
he is about to quit his native land on a grand philological expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who read this book with attention&mdash;and the author
begs to observe that it would be of little utility to read it hurriedly&mdash;may
derive much information with respect to matters of philology and literature;
it will be found treating of most of the principal languages from Ireland
to China, and of the literature which they contain. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away from the dingle and Jasper his view of life is as follows&mdash;ale,
Tate and Brady, and the gloves:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested
in the case of Lavengro himself, by the manner in which he is enabled
to make his way in the world up to a certain period, without falling
a prey either to vice or poverty.&nbsp; In his history there is a wonderful
illustration of part of the text quoted by his mother, &lsquo;I have
been young, and now am old, yet never saw I the righteous forsaken,
or his seed begging bread.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is the son of good and honourable
parents, but at the critical period of life, that of entering into the
world, he finds himself without any earthly friend to help him, yet
he manages to make his way; he does not become a Captain in the Life
Guards, it is true, nor does he get into Parliament, nor does the last
chapter conclude in the most satisfactory and unobjectionable manner,
by his marrying a dowager countess, as that wise man Addison did, or
by his settling down as a great country gentleman, perfectly happy and
contented, like the very moral Roderick Random, or the equally estimable
Peregrine Pickle; he is hack author, Gypsy, tinker, and postillion,
yet, upon the whole, he seems to be quite as happy as the younger sons
of most earls, to have as high <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>feelings
of honour; and when the reader loses sight of him, he has money in his
pocket honestly acquired, to enable him to commence a journey quite
as laudable as those which the younger sons of earls generally undertake.&nbsp;
Surely all this is a manifestation of the kindness and providence of
God: and yet he is not a religious person; up to the time when the reader
loses sight of him, he is decidedly not a religious person; he has glimpses,
it is true, of that God who does not forsake him, but he prays very
seldom, is not fond of going to church; and, though he admires Tate
and Brady&rsquo;s version of the Psalms, his admiration is rather caused
by the beautiful poetry which that version contains than the religion;
yet his tale is not finished&mdash;like the tale of the gentleman who
touched objects, and that of the old man who knew Chinese without knowing
what was o&rsquo;clock; perhaps, like them, he is destined to become
religious, and to have, instead of occasional glimpses, frequent and
distinct views of his God; yet, though he may become religious, it is
hardly to be expected that he will become a very precise and strait-laced
person; it is probable that he will retain, with his scholarship, something
of his Gypsyism, his predilection for the hammer and tongs, and perhaps
some inclination to put on certain gloves, not white kid, with any friend
who may be inclined for a little old English diversion, and a readiness
to take a glass of ale, with plenty of malt in it, and as little hop
as may well be&mdash;ale at least two years old&mdash;with the aforesaid
friend, when the diversion is over; for, as it is the belief of the
writer that a person may get to heaven very comfortably without knowing
what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, so it is his belief that he will not be
refused admission there because to the last he has been fond of healthy
and invigorating exercises, and felt a willingness to partake of any
of the good things which it pleases the Almighty to put within the reach
of His children during their sojourn upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>It
is quite evident then that Borrow does not advocate the open air, the
tinkers&rsquo; trade, and a-roving-a-roving, for the sons of gentlemen.&nbsp;
It is not apparent that the open air did his health much good.&nbsp;
As for tinkering, it was, he declares, a necessity and for lack of anything
better to do, and he realised that he was only playing at it.&nbsp;
When he was looking for a subject for his pen he rejected Harry Simms
and Jemmy Abershaw because both, though bold and extraordinary men,
were &ldquo;merely highwaymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when he has known a &ldquo;bad man&rdquo; he cannot
content himself with mere disapproval.&nbsp; Take, for example, his
friends the murderers, Haggart and Thurtell.&nbsp; He shows Haggart
as an ambitious lad too full of life, &ldquo;with fine materials for
a hero.&rdquo;&nbsp; He calls the fatalist&rsquo;s question: &ldquo;Can
an Arabian steed submit to be a vile drudge?&rdquo;&mdash;nonsense,
saying: &ldquo;The greatest victory which a man can achieve is over
himself, by which is meant those unruly passions which are not convenient
to the time and place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But peace to thee, poor David! why should a mortal worm be
sitting in judgment over thee?&nbsp; The Mighty and Just One has already
judged thee, and perhaps above thou hast received pardon for thy crimes,
which could not be pardoned here below; and now that thy feverish existence
has closed, and thy once active form become inanimate dust, thy very
memory all but forgotten, I will say a few words about thee, a few words
soon also to be forgotten.&nbsp; Thou wast the most extraordinary robber
that ever lived within the belt of Britain; Scotland rang with thy exploits,
and England, too, north of the Humber; strange deeds also didst thou
achieve when, fleeing from justice, thou didst find thyself in the sister
Isle; busy wast thou there in town and on curragh, at fair and race-course,
and also in the solitary place.&nbsp; Ireland thought thee her child,
for who spoke her brogue better than thyself?&mdash;she felt proud <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>of
thee, and said, &lsquo;Sure, O&rsquo;Hanlon is come again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What might not have been thy fate in the far west in America, whither
thou hadst turned thine eye, saying, &lsquo;I will go there, and become
an honest man!&rsquo;&nbsp; But thou wast not to go there, David&mdash;the
blood which thou hadst shed in Scotland was to be required of thee;
the avenger was at hand, the avenger of blood.&nbsp; Seized, manacled,
brought back to thy native land, condemned to die, thou wast left in
thy narrow cell, and told to make the most of thy time, for it was short;
and there, in thy narrow cell, and thy time so short, thou didst put
the crowning stone to thy strange deeds, by that strange history of
thyself, penned by thine own hand in the robber tongue.&nbsp; Thou mightest
have been better employed, David!&mdash;but the ruling passion was strong
with thee, even in the jaws of death.&nbsp; Thou mightest have been
better employed!&mdash;but peace be with thee, I repeat, and the Almighty&rsquo;s
grace and pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He makes the jockey speak in the same fashion of Thurtell whom he
went to see hanged, according to an old agreement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived at H--- just in the nick of time.&nbsp; There was
the ugly jail&mdash;the scaffold&mdash;and there upon it stood the only
friend I ever had in the world.&nbsp; Driving my Punch, which was all
in a foam, into the midst of the crowd, which made way for me as if
it knew what I came for, I stood up in my gig, took off my hat, and
shouted, &lsquo;God Almighty bless you, Jack!&rsquo;&nbsp; The dying
man turned his pale grim face towards me&mdash;for his face was always
somewhat grim, do you see&mdash;nodded and said, or I thought I heard
him say, &lsquo;All right, old chap.&rsquo;&nbsp; The next moment .
. . my eyes water.&nbsp; He had a high heart, got into a scrape whilst
in the Marines, lost his half-pay, took to the turf, ring, gambling,
and at last cut the throat of a villain who had robbed him of nearly
all he had.&nbsp; But he had good qualities, and I know for certain
that he never did half the <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>bad
things laid to his charge; for example, he never bribed Tom Oliver to
fight cross, as it was said he did, on the day of the awful thunderstorm.&nbsp;
Ned Flatnose fairly beat Tom Oliver, for though Ned was not what&rsquo;s
called a good fighter, he had a particular blow, which if he could put
in he was sure to win.&nbsp; His right shoulder, do you see, was two
inches farther back than it ought to have been, and consequently his
right fist generally fell short; but if he could swing himself round,
and put in a blow with that right arm, he could kill or take away the
senses of anybody in the world.&nbsp; It was by putting in that blow
in his second fight with Spring that he beat noble Tom.&nbsp; Spring
beat him like a sack in the first battle, but in the second Ned Painter&mdash;for
that was his real name&mdash;contrived to put in his blow, and took
the senses out of Spring; and in like manner he took the senses out
of Tom Oliver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and many
of those who are not hanged are much worse than those who are.&nbsp;
Jack, with many a good quality, is hanged, whilst that fellow of a lord,
who wanted to get the horse from you at about two-thirds of his value,
without a single good quality in the world, is not hanged, and probably
will remain so.&nbsp; You ask the reason why, perhaps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you: the lack of a certain quality called courage, which Jack possessed
in abundance, will preserve him; from the love which he bears his own
neck he will do nothing that can bring him to the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isopel Berners, with Moses and David in her mind, expresses Borrow&rsquo;s
private opinion more soberly when she says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fear God</i>, and take your own part.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Bible in that, young man; see how Moses feared God, and how he took
his own part against everybody who meddled with him.&nbsp; And see how
David feared God, and took his own part against all the bloody enemies
which surrounded him&mdash;<!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>so
fear God, young man, and never give in!&nbsp; The world can bully, and
is fond, provided it sees a man in a kind of difficulty, of getting
about him, calling him coarse names, and even going so far as to hustle
him; but the world, like all bullies, carries a white feather in its
tail, and no sooner sees the man taking off his coat, and offering to
fight its best, than it scatters here and there, and is always civil
to him afterwards.&nbsp; So when folks are disposed to ill-treat you,
young man, say &lsquo;Lord, have mercy upon me!&rsquo; and then tip
them Long Melford, to which, as the saying goes, there is nothing comparable
for shortness all the world over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had probably a natural inclination towards a liberal or eccentric
morality, but he was no thinker, and he gave way to a middle-class phraseology&mdash;with
exceptions, as when he gives it as the opinion of his old master, the
Norwich solicitor, that &ldquo;all first-rate thieves were sober, and
of well-regulated morals, their bodily passions being kept in abeyance
by their love of gain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes Borrow allows these two
sides of him, his private and his social sides, to appear together dramatically.&nbsp;
For example, he more than half seriously advises Jasper to read the
Scriptures and learn his duty to his fellow-creatures and his duty to
his own soul, lest he should be ranked with those who are &ldquo;outcast,
despised and miserable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Jasper questions him
and gets him to admit that the Gypsies are very much like the cuckoos,
roguish, chaffing birds that everybody is glad to see again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door fowls,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say I should, Jasper, whatever some people
might wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the chals and chies into radical weavers and factory
wenches, hey, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I should, Jasper.&nbsp; You are
certainly a picturesque people, and in many respects an ornament both
<!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>to
town and country; painting and lil writing too are under great obligations
to you.&nbsp; What pretty pictures are made out of your campings and
groupings, and what pretty books have been written in which Gypsies,
or at least creatures intended to represent Gypsies, have been the principal
figures!&nbsp; I think if we were without you, we should begin to miss
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all converted
into barn-door fowls.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, frequently as
I have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time, and heard the cuckoo,
I have thought that we chals and cuckoos are alike in many respects,
but especially in character.&nbsp; Everybody speaks ill of us both,
and everybody is glad to see both of us again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men
and cuckoos; men have souls, Jasper!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why not cuckoos, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little
short of blasphemy.&nbsp; How should a bird have a soul?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how should a man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We know very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you take your oath of it, brother&mdash;your
bodily oath?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I think I might, Jasper!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Borrow liked a strong or an extraordinary
man none the less for being a scoundrel.&nbsp; There is equally little
doubt that he never demeaned himself with the lower orders.&nbsp; He
never pretended, and was seldom taken, to be one of themselves.&nbsp;
His attitude differed in degree, but not in kind, from that of a frank,
free squire or parson towards keepers, fishermen or labourers.&nbsp;
And if he did not drink and swear on an equality with them, neither
did he crankily worship them as Fitzgerald did &ldquo;Posh,&rdquo; <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the
fisherman.&nbsp; They respected him&mdash;at least so he tells us&mdash;and
he never gives himself away to any other effect&mdash;because he was
honest, courageous and fair.&nbsp; Thus he never gave cause for suspicion
as a man does who throws off the cloak of class, and he was probably
as interesting to them as they to him.&nbsp; Nor did his refusal to
adopt their ways and manners out and out prevent a very genuine kind
of equality from existing between him and some of them.&nbsp; A man
or woman of equal character and force became his equal, as Jasper did,
as Isopel and David Haggart did, and he accepted this equality without
a trace of snobbishness.</p>
<p>He says himself that he has &ldquo;no abstract love for what is low,
or what the world calls low.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly there is nothing
low in his familiars, as he presents them, at least nothing sordid.&nbsp;
It may be the result of unconscious idealisation, but his Gypsies have
nothing more sordid about them than wild birds have.&nbsp; Mrs. Herne
is diabolical, but in a manner that would not be unbecoming to a duchess.&nbsp;
Leonora is treacherous, but as an elf is permitted to be.&nbsp; As for
Jasper and Mrs. Petulengro, they are as radiant as Mercutio and Rosalind.&nbsp;
They have all the sweetness of unimprisoned air: they would prefer,
like Borrow, &ldquo;the sound of the leaves and the tinkling of the
waters&rdquo; to the parson and the church; and the smell of the stable,
which is strong in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo;
to the smell of the congregation and the tombs.</p>
<h2><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>CHAPTER
XXVIII&mdash;WALKING TOURS</h2>
<p>When Borrow had almost finished &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; he went
on a visit to his cousins in Cornwall.&nbsp; The story of his saving
a man&rsquo;s life in a stormy sea had reached them, and they sent him
an invitation, which he accepted at Christmas time in 1853.&nbsp; He
stayed for a fortnight with a cousin&rsquo;s married daughter, Mrs.
Anne Taylor, at Penquite Farm, near Liskeard, and then several days
again after a fortnight spent on a walk to Land&rsquo;s End and back.&nbsp;
In his last week he walked to Tintagel and Pentire.&nbsp; He was welcomed
with hospitality and admiration.&nbsp; He in turn seems to have been
pleased and at his ease, though he only understood half of what was
said.&nbsp; Those who remember his visit speak of his tears in the house
where his father was born, of his sitting in the centre of a group telling
stories of his travels and singing a Gypsy song, of his singing foreign
songs all day out of doors, of his fit of melancholy cured by Scotch
and Irish airs played on the piano, of his violent opinions on sherry
and &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo; of his protesting against
some sign of gentility by using a filthy rag as a pocket handkerchief,
and that in a conspicuous manner, of his being vain and not proud, of
his telling the children stories, of one child crying out at sight of
him: &ldquo;That <i>is</i> a man!&rdquo;&nbsp; He made his mark by unusual
ways and by intellectual superiority to his rustic cousins.&nbsp; He
rode about with one of his cousin&rsquo;s grandchildren.&nbsp; He walked
hither and thither alone, doing as much as twenty-five miles a day with
the help of &ldquo;Look out, look out, Svend Vonved,&rdquo; which he
sang in the last dark <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>stretches
of road.&nbsp; Mr. Walling was &ldquo;told that he roamed the Caradons
in all weathers without a hat, in search of sport and specimens, antiquities
and dialects,&rdquo; but I should think the &ldquo;specimens&rdquo;
were for the table.&nbsp; He talked to the men by the wayside or dived
into the slums of Liskeard for disreputable characters.&nbsp; He visited
remarkable and famous places, and was delighted with &ldquo;Druidic&rdquo;
remains and tales of fairies.</p>
<p>Thus Borrow made &ldquo;fifty quarto pages&rdquo; of notes, says
Knapp, about people, places, dialect, and folk lore.&nbsp; Some of the
notes are mere shorthand; some are rapid gossipy jottings; and they
include; a verse translation of a Cornish tale.</p>
<p>A book on Cornwall, to have grown out of these notes, was advertised;
but it was never written.&nbsp; Perhaps he found it hard to vivify or
integrate his notes.&nbsp; In any case there could hardly have been
any backbone to the book, and it would have been tourist&rsquo;s work,
however good.&nbsp; He was not a man who wrote about everything; the
impulse was lacking and he went on with the furious Appendix to &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1854 he paid a much longer visit to Wales.&nbsp; He took his wife
and daughter as far as Llangollen, which he used as a centre during
August.&nbsp; Then he had ten days walking through Corwen, Cerrig-y-Drudion,
Capel Curig, Bangor, Anglesey, Snowdon, Beth Gelert, Festiniog, and
Bala.&nbsp; After three weeks more at Llangollen, he had his boots soled
and his umbrella mended, bought a leather satchel with a lock and key,
and put in it a white linen shirt, a pair of worsted stockings, a razor,
and a prayer book, and with twenty pounds in his pocket and his umbrella
grasped in the middle, set out on a tour of three weeks.&nbsp; He travelled
through the whole length of Wales, by Llangarmon, Sycharth, Bala, Machynlleth,
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge, Plinlimmon, Pont Rhyd Fendigaid, Strata Florida,
Tregaron, Lampeter, Pumpsaint, <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Llandovery,
Llangadog, Gwynfe, Gutter Fawr (Brynamman), Swansea, Neath, Merthyr,
Caerphilly, Newport, and Chepstow.&nbsp; He had loved the Welsh bards
and Wales from his boyhood up, and these three months kept him occupied
and happy.&nbsp; When at Llangollen he walked during the day, and in
the evening showed his wife and stepdaughter a view, if he had found
one.&nbsp; His wife reported to his mother that she had reason to praise
God for his condition.</p>
<p>Borrow was happy at seeing the places mentioned by the bards and
the houses where some of them were born.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the wild hills
of Wales,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the land of old renown and of
wonder, the land of Arthur and Merlin!&rdquo;&nbsp; These were the very
tones of his Spanish enthusiasm nearly twenty years ago.&nbsp; He travelled
probably without maps, and with no general knowledge of the country
or of what had been written of it, so that he did not know how to spell
Manorbier or recognise it as the birthplace of Gerald of Wales.&nbsp;
He remembered his youth, when he translated the bards, with complacent
melancholy.&nbsp; He sunned himself in the admiration of his inferiors,
talking at great length on subjects with which he was acquainted and
repeating his own execrable verse translations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice man&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;civil
man&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;clever man . . . has been everywhere,&rdquo;
the people said.&nbsp; In the South, too, he had the supreme good fortune
to meet Captain Bosvile for the first time for thirty years, and not
being recognised, said, &ldquo;I am the chap what certain folks calls
the Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bejiggered if the Captain had not been
thinking it was he, and goes on to ask after that &ldquo;fine young
woman and a vartuous&rdquo; that he used to keep company with, and Borrow
in his turn asked after Jasper&mdash;&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; was the answer,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t think what grand folks he and his wife have become
of late years, and all along of a trumpery lil which somebody has written
about them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also met an Italian whose friends he had
last seen at Norwich, one whom he had found at Corunna.&nbsp; <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>It
is no wonder that it seemed to him he had always had &ldquo;the health
of an elephant,&rdquo; and could walk thirty-four miles a day, and the
last mile in ten minutes.&nbsp; He took his chance for a night&rsquo;s
lodging, content to have someone else&rsquo;s bed, but going to the
best inn where he had a choice, as at Haverfordwest.</p>
<p>He was very much moved by the adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a wonderful
deal to say if I once begin; I have been everywhere,&rdquo; he said
to the old man at Gutter Fawr.&nbsp; He gave the shepherd advice about
his sheep.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in the habit,&rdquo; he said to the landlord
at Pont Erwyd, &ldquo;of talking about everything, being versed in all
matters, do you see, or affecting to be so, which comes much to the
same thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even in the company of his stepdaughter&mdash;as
they were not in Hyde Park&mdash;he sang in Welsh at the top of his
voice.&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s hospitality in Mona brought tears to
his eyes; so did his own verse translation of the &ldquo;Ode to Sycharth,&rdquo;
because it made him think &ldquo;how much more happy, innocent and holy
I was in the days of my boyhood when I translated Iolo&rsquo;s ode than
I am at the present time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He kissed the silver cup at Llanddewi
Brefi and the tombstone of Huw Morus at Llan Silin.&nbsp; When the chair
of Huw Morus was wiped and he was about to sit down in it, he uncovered
and said in his best Welsh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shade of Huw Morus, supposing your shade haunts the
place which you loved so well when alive&mdash;a Saxon, one of the seed
of the Coiling Serpent, has come to this place to pay that respect to
true genius, the Dawn Duw, which he is ever ready to pay.&nbsp; He read
the songs of the Nightingale of Ceiriog in the most distant part of
Lloegr, when he was a brown-haired boy, and now that he is a grey-haired
man he is come to say in this place that they frequently made his eyes
overflow with tears of rapture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then sat down in the chair, and commenced repeating verses
of Huw Morus.&nbsp; All which I did in the presence of <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the
stout old lady, the short, buxom, and bare-armed damsel, and of John
Jones, the Calvinistic weaver of Llangollen, all of whom listened patiently
and approvingly though the rain was pouring down upon them, and the
branches of the trees and the tops of the tall nettles, agitated by
the gusts from the mountain hollows, were beating in their faces, for
enthusiasm is never scoffed at by the noble, simple-minded, genuine
Welsh, whatever treatment it may receive from the coarse-hearted, sensual,
selfish Saxon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unless we count the inn at Cemmaes, where he took vengeance on the
suspicious people by using his note-book in an obvious manner, &ldquo;now
skewing at an object, now leering at an individual,&rdquo; he was only
once thoroughly put out, and that was at Beth Gelert by a Scotchman:
which suggests a great deal of amiability, on one side, considering
that Borrow&rsquo;s Welsh was book-Welsh, execrably pronounced.</p>
<p>He filled four books with notes, says Knapp, who has printed from
them some parts which Borrow did not use, including the Orange words
of &ldquo;Croppies lie down,&rdquo; and Borrow&rsquo;s translation of
&ldquo;the best ghost story in the world,&rdquo; by Lope de Vega.&nbsp;
The book founded on these Welsh notes was advertised in 1857, but not
published until 1862.</p>
<p>In the September after his Welsh holiday, 1855, Borrow took his wife
and daughter to the Isle of Man, deposited them at Douglas, and travelled
over the island for seven weeks, with intervals at Douglas.&nbsp; He
took notes that make ninety-six quarto pages in Knapp&rsquo;s copy.&nbsp;
He was to have founded a book on them, entitled, &ldquo;Wanderings in
Quest of Manx Literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Knapp quotes an introduction
which was written.&nbsp; This and the notes show him collecting in manuscript
or <i>viva voce</i> the <i>carvals</i> or carols then in circulation
among the Manx; and he had the good fortune to receive two volumes of
them as gifts.&nbsp; Some he translated during his visit.&nbsp; He went
about questioning people concerning <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the
carvals and a Manx poet, named George Killey.&nbsp; He read a Manx prayer-book
to the poet&rsquo;s daughter at Kirk Onchan, and asked her a score of
questions.&nbsp; He convinced one woman that he was &ldquo;of the old
Manx.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finding a Manxman who spoke French and thought it
the better language, he made the statement that &ldquo;Manx or something
like it was spoken in France more than a thousand years before French.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He copied Runic inscriptions, and took down several fairy tales and
a Manx version of the story of &ldquo;Finn McCoyle&rdquo; and the Scotch
giant.&nbsp; He went to visit a descendant of the ballad hero, Mollie
Charane.&nbsp; When he wished to know the size of some old skeletons
he inquired if the bones were as large as those of modern ones.&nbsp;
As he met people to compliment him on his Manx, so he did on his walking.&nbsp;
Knapp speaks of a &ldquo;terrible journey&rdquo; over the mountain from
Ramsay to Braddan and Douglas in October, but does not make any quotation
relating to it.&nbsp; In his opinion the notes &ldquo;seldom present
any matter of general interest save to the islanders of Man and the
student of Runic inscriptions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Enough, however, is quoted
to show that Borrow was delighted with the country and the people, finding
plenty to satisfy his curiosity in languages and customs.&nbsp; But
he was irritable, and committed to paper some sarcastic remarks about
Sir John Bowring and Lord Raglan, &ldquo;the secret friend&rdquo; of
Russia; while the advancement of an enemy and the death of a cousin
caused him to reflect: &ldquo;William Borrow, the wonderful inventor,
dead, and Leicester Curzon . . . a colonel.&nbsp; Pretty justice!&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1862, in the pages of &ldquo;Once a Week,&rdquo; he published two
of his Manx translations, the ballads&mdash;&ldquo;Brown William&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mollie Charane.&rdquo;&nbsp; In August and September, 1857,
Borrow was walking again in Wales, covering four hundred miles, as he
told John Murray, and once, at least, between Builth and Mortimer&rsquo;s
Cross, making twenty-eight miles in a day.&nbsp; His route was through
Laugharne, Saundersfoot, Tenby, <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>Pembroke,
Milford and Milford Haven, Stainton, Johnston, Haverfordwest, St. Davids,
Fishguard, Newport, Cardigan, Llechryd, Cilgerran, Cenarth, Newcastle
Emlyn, Lampeter, Llanddewi Brefi, Builth, Presteign, Mortimer&rsquo;s
Cross, and so to Shrewsbury, and to Uppington, where Goronwy Owen was
curate in the middle of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; Knapp transcribed
part of Borrow&rsquo;s journal for Messrs. T. C. Cantrill and J. Pringle,
remarking that the rubbed pencil writing took him eight days to decipher.&nbsp;
With the annotations of Messrs. Cantrill and Pringle it was printed
in &ldquo;Y Cymmrodor,&rdquo; <a name="citation270a"></a><a href="#footnote270a">{270a}</a>
the journal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion.&nbsp; I will
quote one day&rsquo;s entries, with the annotations, which are the fruit
of the most patient devotion:</p>

<p>Not much of this second tour can be shown to have been used in &ldquo;Wild
Wales,&rdquo; where he alludes to it in the ninety-third chapter, saying
that he &ldquo;long subsequently&rdquo; found some of the wildest solitudes
and most romantic scenery among the mountains about Tregaron; but the
collier may have given him the suggestion for the encounter with Bosvile
in the ninety-eighth chapter.&nbsp; The spelling points to Borrow&rsquo;s
ignorance of the relation of pronunciation and orthography.</p>
<p>In 1858 Borrow&rsquo;s mother died at Oulton and was buried in Oulton
churchyard.&nbsp; During October and November in that year, partly to
take his mind from his bereavement, he was walking in the Scottish Highlands
and Islands.&nbsp; His <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>note-book
contains &ldquo;nothing of general interest,&rdquo; says Knapp, except
an imperfect outline of the journey, showing that he was at Oban, Tobermory,
the Mull of Cantire, Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dingwall,
Tain, Dornoch, Helmsdale, Wick, John o&rsquo;Groats, Thurso, Stromness,
Kirkwall, and Lerwick.</p>
<p>In 1860, after taking a house at 20, Hereford Square, West Brompton,
he and his wife and stepdaughter went to Dublin, and himself walked
to Connemara and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.&nbsp; His wife thought
this journey &ldquo;full of adventure and interest,&rdquo; but he left
no record of it.&nbsp; They were again in Ireland in 1866, Miss Clarke
having lately married a Dr. MacOubrey, of Belfast.&nbsp; Borrow himself
crossed over to Stranraer and had a month&rsquo;s walking in Scotland,
to Glen Luce, Castle Douglas, Dumfries, Ecclefechan, Carlisle, Gilnochie,
Hawick, Jedburgh, Yetholm, Kelso, Melrose, Coldstream, Berwick, and
Edinburgh.&nbsp; He talked to the people, admired the scenery, bathed,
and enjoyed his meals.&nbsp; He left the briefest of journals, but afterwards,
in &ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil,&rdquo; published an account of the &ldquo;Gypsy
toon&rdquo; of Kirk Yetholm and how he was introduced to the Gypsy Queen.&nbsp;
He dropped his umbrella and flung his arms three times up into the air
and asked her in Romany what her name was, and if she was a mumper or
a true Gypsy.&nbsp; She asked him what was the meaning of this &ldquo;gibberish,&rdquo;
but he describes how gradually he made her declare herself, and how
she examined him in Gypsy and at last offered him a chair, and entered
into &ldquo;deep discourse&rdquo; about Gypsy matters.&nbsp; He talked
as he did to such people, saying &ldquo;Whoy, I calls that a juggal,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; He found fault with her Romany, which was thin and mixed
with Gaelic and cant words.&nbsp; She told him that he reminded her
of her grandfather, Will Faa, &ldquo;being a tall, lusty man like himself,
and having a skellying look with the left eye, just like him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He displayed his knowledge of the affairs of the <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>tribe,
both in her country and in England.&nbsp; She told him that she had
never heard so much Romany before.&nbsp; She promised to receive him
next day, but was out when he called.&nbsp; He found her at St. George&rsquo;s
Fair, near Roxburgh Castle, and she pointed him out several other Gypsies,
but as she assured him they knew not a word of Romany and would only
be uncivil to him, he left them to &ldquo;pay his respects at the tomb
of Walter Scott, a man with whose principles he had no sympathy, but
for whose genius he had always entertained the most intense admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1868 he took an autumn walk through Sussex and Hampshire while
his wife was at Bognor.&nbsp; In the next year his wife died, after
being afflicted for some time by troubles connected with her property,
by dropsy, valvular disease of the heart, and &ldquo;hysteria.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow was melancholy and irritable, but apparently did not go for another
walk in Scotland as was suggested for a cure; nor ever again did he
get far afield on foot.</p>

XXIX&mdash;&ldquo;WILD WALES&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In 1862, between Borrow&rsquo;s two visits to Ireland, his &ldquo;Wild
Wales&rdquo; was published.&nbsp; It had been heralded by an advertisement
in 1857, by the publication of the &ldquo;Sleeping Bard&rdquo; in 1860,
and by an article on &ldquo;The Welsh and their Literature&rdquo; in
the &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; for January, 1861.&nbsp; This article quotes
&ldquo;an unpublished work called &lsquo;Wild Wales&rsquo;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s unpublished work, &lsquo;Celtic Bards, Chiefs
and Kings.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It opened with a vivid story of the coming
of Hu Gadarn and his Cymry to Britain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hu and his people took possession of the best parts of the
island, either driving the few Gaels to other districts or admitting
them to their confederacy.&nbsp; As the country was in a very wild state,
much overgrown with forests in which bears and wolves wandered, and
abounding with deep stagnant pools, which were the haunts of the avanc
or crocodile, Hu forthwith set about clearing it of some of its horrors,
and making it more fit to be the abiding place of civilised beings.&nbsp;
He made his people cut down woods and forests, and destroy, as far as
was possible, wild beasts and crocodiles.&nbsp; He himself went to a
gloomy pool, the haunt of the king of the efync, baited a huge hook
attached to a cable, flung it into the pool, and when the monster had
gorged the snare drew him out by means of certain gigantic oxen, which
he had tamed to the plough, and burnt his horrid, wet, scaly carcass
on a fire.&nbsp; He then caused enclosures to be made, fields to be
ploughed and sown, pleasant wooden houses to be built, bees to be sheltered
and encouraged, <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>and
schools to be erected where song and music were taught.&nbsp; O a truly
great man was Hu Gadarn! though a warrior, he preferred the sickle and
pruning hook to the sword, and the sound of the song and lute to the
hoarse blast of the buffalo&rsquo;s horn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mighty Hu with mead would pay<br />
The bard for his melodious lay;<br />
The Emperor of land and sea<br />
And of all living things was he.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This probably represents Borrow&rsquo;s view of early history, simple,
heroical and clear, as it would have been had he been in command of
it.&nbsp; The article professed to be a review of Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sleeping
Bard,&rdquo; and was in fact by Borrow himself.&nbsp; He had achieved
the supreme honour of reviewing his own work, and, as it fell out, he
persuaded the public to buy every copy.&nbsp; Very few were found to
buy &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; notwithstanding.&nbsp; The first edition
of a thousand copies lasted three years; the second, of three thousand,
lasted twenty-three years.&nbsp; Borrow was ridiculed for informing
his readers that he paid his bill at a Welsh inn, without mentioning
the amount.&nbsp; He was praised for having written &ldquo;the first
clever book . . . in which an honest attempt is made to do justice to
the Welsh literature,&rdquo; for knowing far more than most educated
Welshmen about that literature, and for describing his travels and encounters
&ldquo;with much of the freshness, humour and geniality of his earlier
days,&rdquo; for writing in fact &ldquo;the best book about Wales ever
published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly no later book which could be compared with it has been
as good, or nearly as good.&nbsp; As for its predecessors, the &ldquo;Itinerary&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Description&rdquo; of Gerald of Wales, even setting aside
the charm of antiquity, make a book that is equal to &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo;
for originality, vivacity and truth.&nbsp; Of the antiquarian and picturesque
travellers in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>none
wrote anything that is valuable except for some facts and some evidence
of taste.&nbsp; Borrow himself probably knew few or none of them, though
he mentions Gerald.&nbsp; There is no evidence that he knew the great
nineteenth-century collections of Welsh manuscripts and translations.&nbsp;
He says nothing of the &ldquo;Mabinogion.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had apparently
never heard of the pedestrian Iolo Morganwg.&nbsp; He perhaps never
saw Stephens&rsquo; &ldquo;Literature of the Kymry.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
knowledge was picked up anyhow and anywhere from Welsh texts and Lhuyd&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia,&rdquo; without system and with very little
friendly discussion or comparison.&nbsp; Wales, therefore, was to him
as wonderful as Spain, and equally uncharted.&nbsp; What he saw did
not spoil the visionary image, and his enthusiasm coupled with curiosity
gives the book of his travels just the continuous impulse which he never
found for his Cornish, Manx, Irish or Scottish notes.&nbsp; He was able
to fill the book with sympathetic observation and genial self-revelation.</p>
<p>The book is of course a tourist&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Borrow went through
the country as a gentleman, running no risks, and having scarcely an
object except to see what was to be seen and to please himself.&nbsp;
He got, as he probably counted on getting, the consideration due to
a gentleman who can pay his way and meets only the humbler sort of people,
publicans, farmers, drovers, labourers, sextons, parish clerks, and
men upon the road.&nbsp; He seldom stayed more than a night or an hour
or two anywhere.&nbsp; His pictures, therefore, are the impressions
of the moment, wrought up at leisure.&nbsp; His few weeks in Wales made
a book of the same size as an equal number of years in Spain.</p>
<p>Sometimes he writes like a detached observer working from notes,
and the result has little value except in so far as it is a pure record
of what was to be seen at such and such a place in the year 1854.&nbsp;
There are many short passages apparently straight from his notes, dead
and useless.&nbsp; <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>The
description of Llangollen Fair, on August 21, is of this kind, but superior,
and I shall quote it entire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day was dull with occasional showers.&nbsp; I went to
see the fair about noon.&nbsp; It was held in and near a little square
in the south-east quarter of the town, of which square the police-station
is the principal feature on the side of the west, and an inn, bearing
the sign of the Grapes, on the east.&nbsp; The fair was a little bustling
fair, attended by plenty of people from the country, and from the English
border, and by some who appeared to come from a greater distance than
the border.&nbsp; A dense row of carts extended from the police-station,
half across the space.&nbsp; These carts were filled with pigs, and
had stout cord nettings drawn over them, to prevent the animals escaping.&nbsp;
By the sides of these carts the principal business of the fair appeared
to be going on&mdash;there stood the owners, male and female, higgling
with Llangollen men and women, who came to buy.&nbsp; The pigs were
all small, and the price given seemed to vary from eighteen to twenty-five
shillings.&nbsp; Those who bought pigs generally carried them away in
their arms; and then there was no little diversion; dire was the screaming
of the porkers, yet the purchaser invariably appeared to know how to
manage his bargain, keeping the left arm round the body of the swine
and with the right hand fast gripping the ear&mdash;some few were led
away by strings.&nbsp; There were some Welsh cattle, small of course,
and the purchasers of these seemed to be Englishmen, tall burly fellows
in general, far exceeding the Welsh in height and size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much business in the cattle-line did not seem, however, to
be going on.&nbsp; Now and then a big fellow made an offer, and held
out his hand for a little Pictish grazier to give it a slap&mdash;a
cattle bargain being concluded by a slap of the hand&mdash;but the Welshman
generally turned away, with a <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>half-resentful
exclamation.&nbsp; There were a few horses and ponies in a street leading
into the fair from the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw none sold, however.&nbsp; A tall athletic figure was
striding amongst them, evidently a jockey and a stranger, looking at
them and occasionally asking a slight question of one or another of
their proprietors, but he did not buy.&nbsp; He might in age be about
eight-and-twenty, and about six feet and three-quarters of an inch in
height; in build he was perfection itself&mdash;a better-built man I
never saw.&nbsp; He wore a cap and a brown jockey coat, trowsers, leggings,
and highlows, and sported a single spur.&nbsp; He had whiskers&mdash;all
jockeys should have whiskers&mdash;but he had what I did not like, and
what no genuine jockey should have, a moustache, which looks coxcombical
and Frenchified&mdash;but most things have terribly changed since I
was young.&nbsp; Three or four hardy-looking fellows, policemen, were
gliding about in their blue coats and leather hats, holding their thin
walking-sticks behind them; conspicuous amongst whom was the leader,
a tall lathy North Briton with a keen eye and hard features.&nbsp; Now
if I add there was much gabbling of Welsh round about, and here and
there some slight sawing of English&mdash;that in the street leading
from the north there were some stalls of gingerbread and a table at
which a queer-looking being with a red Greek-looking cap on his head,
sold rhubarb, herbs, and phials containing the Lord knows what, and
who spoke a low vulgar English dialect,&mdash;I repeat, if I add this,
I think I have said all that is necessary about Llangollen Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is a somewhat exceptional passage, and the same detachment
is rarely found except in his descriptions of scenery, which are short
and serve well enough to remind the reader of the great hills, the rapid
waters, the rocks, and the furnaces, chimneys and pits.&nbsp; Borrow
certainly does remind us of these things.&nbsp; In the first place he
does so by a hundred minute and scattered suggestions of <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the
romantic and sublime, and so general that only a pedant will object
to the nightingales which he heard singing in August near Bethesda.&nbsp;
He gives us black mountains, gloomy shadows, cascades falling into lakes,
&ldquo;singular-looking&rdquo; rocks, and mountain villages like one
in Castile or La Mancha but for the trees, mountains that made him exclaim:
&ldquo;I have had Heaven opened to me,&rdquo; moors of a &ldquo;wretched
russet colour,&rdquo; &ldquo;black gloomy narrow glens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He can also be precise and connoisseur-like, as when he describes the
cataract at Llan Rhaiadr:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I liken it to?&nbsp; I scarcely know, unless to
an immense skein of silk agitated and disturbed by tempestuous blasts,
or to the long tail of a grey courser at furious speed.&nbsp; Through
the profusion of long silvery threads or hairs, or what looked such,
I could here and there see the black sides of the crag down which the
Rhyadr precipitated itself with something between a boom and a roar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is still more a connoisseur when he continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw water falling so gracefully, so much like thin
beautiful threads as here.&nbsp; Yet even this cataract has its blemish.&nbsp;
What beautiful object has not something which more or less mars its
loveliness?&nbsp; There is an ugly black bridge or semicircle of rock,
about two feet in diameter and about twenty feet high, which rises some
little way below it, and under which the water, after reaching the bottom,
passes, which intercepts the sight, and prevents it from taking in the
whole fall at once.&nbsp; This unsightly object has stood where it now
stands since the day of creation, and will probably remain there to
the day of judgment.&nbsp; It would be a desecration of nature to remove
it by art, but no one could regret if nature in one of her floods were
to sweep it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Borrow&rsquo;s temperamental method&mdash;where he undertakes
to do more than sketch his environment in the blurred large method corresponding
to ordinary passing impressions<!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>&mdash;is
the rhetorical sublime of this mountain lake between Festiniog and Bala:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sped towards it through gorse and heather, occasionally
leaping a deep drain.&nbsp; At last I reached it.&nbsp; It was a small
lake.&nbsp; Wearied and panting, I flung myself on its bank, and gazed
upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There lay the lake in the low bottom, surrounded by the heathery
hillocks; there it lay quite still, the hot sun reflected upon its surface,
which shone like a polished blue shield.&nbsp; Near the shore it was
shallow, at least near that shore upon which I lay.&nbsp; But farther
on, my eye, practised in deciding upon the depths of waters, saw reason
to suppose that its depth was very great.&nbsp; As I gazed upon it my
mind indulged in strange musings.&nbsp; I thought of the afanc, a creature
which some have supposed to be the harmless and industrious beaver,
others the frightful and destructive crocodile.&nbsp; I wondered whether
the afanc was the crocodile or the beaver, and speedily had no doubt
that the name was originally applied to the crocodile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, who can doubt,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;that the
word was originally intended for something monstrous and horrible?&nbsp;
Is there not something horrible in the look and sound of the word afanc,
something connected with the opening and shutting of immense jaws, and
the swallowing of writhing prey?&nbsp; Is not the word a fitting brother
of the Arabic timsah, denoting the dread horny lizard of the waters?&nbsp;
Moreover, have we not the voice of tradition that the afanc was something
monstrous?&nbsp; Does it not say that Hu the Mighty, the inventor of
husbandry, who brought the Cumry from the summer-country, drew the old
afanc out of the lake of lakes with his four gigantic oxen?&nbsp; Would
he have had recourse to them to draw out the little harmless beaver?&nbsp;
O, surely not.&nbsp; Yet have I no doubt that, when the crocodile had
disappeared from the lands where the Cumric language was spoken, the
name afanc was applied to the <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>beaver,
probably his successor in the pool; the beaver now called in Cumric
Llostlydan, or the broad-tailed, for tradition&rsquo;s voice is strong
that the beaver has at one time been called the afanc.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then I wondered whether the pool before me had been the haunt of the
afanc, considered both as crocodile and beaver.&nbsp; I saw no reason
to suppose that it had not.&nbsp; &lsquo;If crocodiles,&rsquo; thought
I, &lsquo;ever existed in Britain, and who shall say they have not?
seeing that their remains have been discovered, why should they not
have haunted this pool?&nbsp; If beavers ever existed in Britain, and
do not tradition and Giraldus say that they have? why should they not
have existed in this pool?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At a time almost inconceivably remote, when the hills
around were covered with woods, through which the elk and the bison
and the wild cow strolled, when men were rare throughout the lands,
and unlike in most things to the present race&mdash;at such a period&mdash;and
such a period there has been&mdash;I can easily conceive that the afanc-crocodile
haunted this pool, and that when the elk or bison or wild cow came to
drink of its waters, the grim beast would occasionally rush forth, and
seizing his bellowing victim, would return with it to the deeps before
me to luxuriate at his ease upon its flesh.&nbsp; And at time less remote,
when the crocodile was no more, and though the woods still covered the
hills, and wild cattle strolled about, men were more numerous than before,
and less unlike the present race, I can easily conceive this lake to
have been the haunt of the afanc-beaver, that he here built cunningly
his house of trees and clay, and that to this lake the native would
come with his net and his spear to hunt the animal for his precious
fur.&nbsp; Probably if the depths of that pool were searched, relics
of the crocodile and the beaver might be found, along with other strange
things connected with the periods in which they respectively lived.&nbsp;
Happy were I if for a brief space I could become a Cingalese, that I
might swim out <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>far
into that pool, dive down into its deepest part, and endeavour to discover
any strange things which beneath its surface may lie.&rsquo;&nbsp; Much
in this guise rolled my thoughts as I lay stretched on the margin of
the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another place he tells a poor man that he believes in the sea-serpent,
and has a story of one seen in the very neighbourhood where he meets
the man.&nbsp; Immediately after the description of the lake there is
a proof&mdash;one of many&mdash;that he was writing straight from notes.&nbsp;
Speaking of a rivulet, he says: &ldquo;It was crossed by two bridges,
one immensely old and terribly delapidated, the other old enough, but
in better repair&mdash;<i>went and drank under the oldest bridge of
the two</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book is large and strong enough to stand
many such infinitesimal blemishes.</p>
<p>Alongside of the sublime I will put what Borrow says he liked better.&nbsp;
He is standing on a bridge over the Ceiriog, just after visiting the
house of Huw Morus at Pont y Meibion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a hundred yards distant was a small watermill, built
over the rivulet, the wheel going slowly, slowly round; large quantities
of pigs, the generality of them brindled, were either browsing on the
banks, or lying close to the sides, half immersed in the water; one
immense white hog, the monarch seemingly of the herd, was standing in
the middle of the current.&nbsp; Such was the scene which I saw from
the bridge, a scene of quiet rural life well suited to the brushes of
two or three of the old Dutch painters, or to those of men scarcely
inferior to them in their own style&mdash;Gainsborough, Moreland, and
Crome.&nbsp; My mind for the last half-hour had been in a highly-excited
state; I had been repeating verses of old Huw Morus, brought to my recollection
by the sight of his dwelling-place; they were ranting roaring verses,
against the Roundheads.&nbsp; I admired the vigour, but disliked the
principles which they displayed; and admiration on the <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>one
hand, and disapproval on the other, bred a commotion in my mind like
that raised on the sea when tide runs one way and wind blows another.&nbsp;
The quiet scene from the bridge, however, produced a sedative effect
on my mind, and when I resumed my journey I had forgotten Huw, his verses,
and all about Roundheads and Cavaliers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it must be said that if the book is on the whole a cheerful one,
its cheerfulness not only receives a foil from the rhetorical sublime,
but is a little misted by a melancholy note here and there.&nbsp; Thus
he sees &ldquo;a melancholy ship&rdquo; out on the sea near Holyhead.&nbsp;
He qualifies russet twice as &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; in describing a
moor.&nbsp; He speaks of &ldquo;strange-looking&rdquo; hills near Pont
Erwyd, and again near the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge.&nbsp; His moods were
easily changed.&nbsp; He speaks of &ldquo;wretched russet hills,&rdquo;
with no birds singing, but only &ldquo;the lowing of a wretched bullock,&rdquo;
and then of beautiful hills that filled his veins with fresh life so
that he walked on merrily.</p>
<p>As for his people, it cannot be asserted that they are always alive
though they are often very Welsh.&nbsp; They are sketched, with dialogue
and description, after the manner of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo;
though being nearer home they had to be more modest in their peculiarities.&nbsp;
He establishes Welsh enthusiasm, hospitality and suspiciousness, in
a very friendly manner.&nbsp; The poet-innkeeper is an excellent sketch
of a mild but by no means spiritless type.&nbsp; He is accompanied by
a man with a bulging shoe who drinks ale and continually ejaculates:
&ldquo;The greatest poet in the world&rdquo;; for example, when Borrow
asks: &ldquo;Then I have the honour to be seated with a bard of Anglesey?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; says the bard.&nbsp; Borrow agrees with him
that envy&mdash;which has kept him from the bardic chair&mdash;will
not always prevail:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the man in grey, &lsquo;I am delighted
to hear you.&nbsp; Give me your hand, your honourable hand.&nbsp; Sir,
you have <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>now
felt the hand-grasp of a Welshman, to say nothing of an Anglesey bard,
and I have felt that of a Briton, perhaps a bard, a brother, sir?&nbsp;
O, when I first saw your face out there in the dyffryn, I at once recognised
in it that of a kindred spirit, and I felt compelled to ask you to drink.&nbsp;
Drink, sir! but how is this? the jug is empty&mdash;how is this?&mdash;O,
I see&mdash;my friend, sir, though an excellent individual, is indiscreet,
sir&mdash;very indiscreet.&nbsp; Landlord, bring this moment another
jug of ale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The greatest prydydd,&rsquo; stuttered he of the bulged
shoe&mdash;&lsquo;the greatest prydydd&mdash;Oh&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tut, tut,&rsquo; said the man in grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I speak the truth and care for no one,&rsquo; said
he of the tattered hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I say the greatest prydydd.&nbsp;
If any one wishes to gainsay me let him show his face, and Myn Diawl&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The landlord brought the ale, placed it on the table, and then stood
as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you are waiting to be paid,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;what is your demand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sixpence for this jug, and sixpence for the other,&rsquo;
said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took out a shilling and said: &lsquo;It is but right that
I should pay half of the reckoning, and as the whole affair is merely
a shilling matter I should feel obliged in being permitted to pay the
whole, so, landlord, take the shilling and remember you are paid.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I then delivered the shilling to the landlord, but had no sooner done
so than the man in grey, starting up in violent agitation, wrested the
money from the other, and flung it down on the table before me saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, that will never do.&nbsp; I invited you in
here to drink, and now you would pay for the liquor which I ordered.&nbsp;
You English are free with your money, but you are sometimes free with
it at the expense of people&rsquo;s <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>feelings.&nbsp;
I am a Welshman, and I know Englishmen consider all Welshmen hogs.&nbsp;
But we are not hogs, mind you! for we have little feelings which hogs
have not.&nbsp; Moreover, I would have you know that we have money,
though perhaps not so much as the Saxon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then putting his
hand into his pocket he pulled out a shilling, and giving it to the
landlord, said in Welsh: &lsquo;Now thou art paid, and mayst go thy
ways till thou art again called for.&nbsp; I do not know why thou didst
stay after thou hadst put down the ale.&nbsp; Thou didst know enough
of me to know that thou didst run no risk of not being paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, after the landlord had departed,
&lsquo;I must insist on being [? <i>paying</i>] my share.&nbsp; Did
you not hear me say that I would give a quart of ale to see a poet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A poet&rsquo;s face,&rsquo; said the man in grey, &lsquo;should
be common to all, even like that of the sun.&nbsp; He is no true poet,
who would keep his face from the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the sun frequently hides
his head from the world, behind a cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; said the man in grey.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
sun does not hide his face, it is the cloud that hides it.&nbsp; The
sun is always glad enough to be seen, and so is the poet.&nbsp; If both
are occasionally hid, trust me it is no fault of theirs.&nbsp; Bear
that in mind; and now pray take up your money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That man is a gentleman,&rsquo; thought I to myself,
&lsquo;whether poet or not; but I really believe him to be a poet; were
he not he could hardly talk in the manner I have just heard him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in grey now filled my glass, his own and that of his
companion.&nbsp; The latter emptied his in a minute, not forgetting
first to say &lsquo;the best prydydd in all the world!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The man in grey was also not slow to empty his own.&nbsp; The jug now
passed rapidly between my two friends, for the poet seemed determined
to have his full share of the beverage.&nbsp; <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>I
allowed the ale in my glass to remain untasted, and began to talk about
the bards, and to quote from their works.&nbsp; I soon found that the
man in grey knew quite as much of the old bards and their works as myself.&nbsp;
In one instance he convicted me of a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had quoted those remarkable lines in which an old bard,
doubtless seeing the Menai Bridge by means of second sight, says: &lsquo;I
will pass to the land of Mona notwithstanding the waters of Menai, without
waiting for the ebb&rsquo;&mdash;and was feeling not a little proud
of my erudition when the man in grey, after looking at me for a moment
fixedly, asked me the name of the bard who composed them&mdash;&lsquo;Sion
Tudor,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There you are wrong,&rsquo; said the man in grey; &lsquo;his
name was not Sion Tudor, but Robert Vychan, in English, Little Bob.&nbsp;
Sion Tudor wrote an englyn on the Skerries whirlpool in the Menai; but
it was Little Bob who wrote the stanza in which the future bridge over
the Menai is hinted at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are right.&nbsp;
Well, I am glad that all song and learning are not dead in Ynis Fon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dead,&rsquo; said the man in grey, whose features began
to be rather flushed, &lsquo;they are neither dead, nor ever will be.&nbsp;
There are plenty of poets in Anglesey. . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole sketch is in Borrow&rsquo;s liberal unqualified style,
but keeping on the right side of caricature.&nbsp; The combination of
modesty, touchiness and pride, without humour, is typical and happily
caught.</p>
<p>The chief fault of his Welsh portraits, in fact, is his almost invariable,
and almost always unnecessary, exhibition of his own superiority.&nbsp;
He is nearly always the big clever gentleman catechizing certain quaint
little rustic foreigners.&nbsp; He met one old man with a crabstick
who told him his Welsh was almost as bad as his English, and a drover
who had the advantage of him in decided opinions and a sense <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>of
superiority, and put him down as a pig-jobber; but these are exceptions.&nbsp;
He is not unkind, but on the other hand he forgets that as a rule his
size, his purse, and his remarkable appearance and qualities put his
casual hosts very much at a disadvantage, and he is thus led to exaggerate
what suspiciousness he observed.</p>
<p>His success is all the more wonderful when his position and his almost
total lack of condescension and concession are considered, but considered
they must be.&nbsp; When he met a Welsh clergyman who could talk about
the Welsh language, Huw Morus and ale, he said nothing about him except
that he was &ldquo;a capital specimen of the Welsh country clergyman.&nbsp;
His name was Walter Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; Too often he merely got answers
to his questions, which break up his pages in an agreeable manner, but
do little more.&nbsp; In such conversations we should fare ill indeed
if one of the parties were not Borrow, and even as it is, he can be
tedious beyond the limits necessary for truth.&nbsp; I will give an
example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a little time I entered into conversation with my guide.&nbsp;
He had not a word of English.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you married?&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In truth I am, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What family have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have a daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the house of the Rhyadr.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you live there as servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir, I live there as master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is the good woman I saw there your wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In truth, sir, she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the young girl I saw your daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir, she is my daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how came the good woman not to tell me you were
her husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I
suppose, sir, you did not ask who I was, and she thought you did not
care to know.&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>To multiply instances might cease to be amusing.&nbsp; It may have
been Borrow&rsquo;s right way of getting what he wanted, though it sounds
like a Charity Organization inquisitor.&nbsp; As to the effectiveness
of setting down every step of the process instead of the result, there
can hardly be two opinions, unless the reader prefers an impression
of the wandering inquisitive gentleman to one of the people questioned.&nbsp;
Probably these barren dialogues may be set down to indolence or to the
too facile adoption of a trick.&nbsp; They are too casual and slight
to be exact, and on the other hand they are too literal to give a direct
impression.</p>
<p>Luckily he diversified such conversation with stories of poets and
robbers, gleaned from his books or from wayside company.&nbsp; The best
of this company was naturally not the humble homekeeping publican or
cottager, but the man or woman of the roads, Gypsy or Irish.&nbsp; The
vagabond Irish, for example, give him early in the book an effective
contrast to the more quiet Welsh; his guide tells how they gave him
a terrible fright:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been across the Berwyn to carry home a piece of weaving
work to a person who employs me.&nbsp; It was night as I returned, and
when I was about half-way down the hill, at a place which is called
Allt Paddy, because the Gwyddelod are in the habit of taking up their
quarters there, I came upon a gang of them, who had come there and camped
and lighted their fire, whilst I was on the other side of the hill.&nbsp;
There were nearly twenty of them, men and women, and amongst the rest
was a man standing naked in a tub of water with two women stroking him
down with clouts.&nbsp; He was a large fierce-looking fellow, and his
body, on which the flame of the fire glittered, was nearly covered with
red hair.&nbsp; I never saw such a sight.&nbsp; As I passed they glared
at me and talked violently in their Paddy <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Gwyddel,
but did not offer to molest me.&nbsp; I hastened down the hill, and
right glad I was when I found myself safe and sound at my house in Llangollen,
with my money in my pocket, for I had several shillings there, which
the man across the hill had paid me for the work which I had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best man in the book is the Irish fiddler, with a shock of red
hair, a hat that had lost part of its crown and all its rim, and a game
leg.&nbsp; This Irishman in the early part of the book and the Irishwoman
at the end are characters that Borrow could put his own blood into.&nbsp;
He has done so in a manner equal to anything in the same kind in his
earlier books.&nbsp; I shall quote the whole interview with the man.&nbsp;
It is an admirable piece of imagination.&nbsp; If any man thinks it
anything else, let him spend ten years in taking down conversations
in trains and taverns and ten years in writing them up, and should he
have anything as good as this to show, he has a most rare talent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morning to you,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good marning to your hanner, a merry afternoon, and
a roaring joyous evening&mdash;that is the worst luck I wish to ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you a native of these parts?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not exactly, your hanner&mdash;I am a native of the
city of Dublin, or, what&rsquo;s all the same thing, of the village
of Donnybrook which is close by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A celebrated place,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your hanner may say that; all the world has heard of
Donnybrook, owing to the humours of its fair.&nbsp; Many is the merry
tune I have played to the boys at that fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a professor of music, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And not a very bad one as your hanner will say if you
will allow me to play you a tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you play &ldquo;Croppies Lie Down&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot, your hanner; my fingers never learnt to play
<!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>such
a blackguard tune; but if ye wish to hear &ldquo;Croppies Get Up&rdquo;
I can oblige ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a Roman Catholic, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am not, your hanner&mdash;I am a Catholic to the
backbone, just like my father before me.&nbsp; Come, your hanner, shall
I play ye &ldquo;Croppies Get Up&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a tune that doesn&rsquo;t
please my ears.&nbsp; If, however, you choose to play &ldquo;Croppies
Lie Down,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll give you a shilling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your hanner will give me a shilling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you play &ldquo;Croppies
Lie Down&rdquo;: but you know you cannot play it, your fingers never
learned the tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They never did, your hanner; but they have heard it
played of ould by the blackguard Orange fiddlers of Dublin on the first
of July, when the Protestant boys used to walk round Willie&rsquo;s
statue on College Green&mdash;so if your hanner gives me the shilling
they may perhaps bring out something like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;begin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, your hanner, what shall we do for the words?&nbsp;
Though my fingers may remember the tune, my tongue does not remember
the words&mdash;that is unless . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give another shilling,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but
never mind you the words; I know the words, and will repeat them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And your hanner will give me a shilling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you play the tune,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hanner bright, your hanner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Honour bright,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon the fiddler, taking his bow and shouldering his
fiddle, struck up in first-rate style the glorious tune, which I had
so often heard with rapture in the days of my boyhood in the barrack
yard of Clonmel; whilst I walking by his side as he stumped along, caused
the welkin to resound with the words, which were the delight of the
young <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>gentlemen
of the Protestant academy of that beautiful old town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never heard those words before,&rsquo; said the fiddler,
after I had finished the first stanza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get on with you,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Regular Orange words!&rsquo; said the fiddler, on my
finishing the second stanza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you choose to get on?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;More blackguard Orange words I never heard!&rsquo;
cried the fiddler, on my coming to the conclusion of the third stanza.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Divil a bit farther will I play; at any rate till I get the shilling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here it is for you,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;the song
is ended and of course the tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank your hanner,&rsquo; said the fiddler, taking
the money, &lsquo;your hanner has kept your word with me, which is more
than I thought your hanner would.&nbsp; And now, your hanner, let me
ask you why did your hanner wish for that tune, which is not only a
blackguard one, but quite out of date; and where did your hanner get
the words?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I used to hear the tune in my boyish days,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;and wished to hear it again, for though you call it a blackguard
tune, it is the sweetest and most noble air that Ireland, the land of
music, has ever produced.&nbsp; As for the words, never mind where I
got them; they are violent enough, but not half so violent as the words
of some of the songs made against the Irish Protestants by the priests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your hanner is an Orange man, I see.&nbsp; Well, your
hanner, the Orange is now in the kennel, and the Croppies have it all
their own way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And perhaps,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;before I die, the
Orange will be out of the kennel and the Croppies in, even as they were
in my young days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who knows, your hanner? and who knows that I may <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>not
play the ould tune round Willie&rsquo;s image in College Green, even
as I used some twenty-seven years ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O then you have been an Orange fiddler?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have, your hanner.&nbsp; And now as your hanner has
behaved like a gentleman to me I will tell ye all my history.&nbsp;
I was born in the city of Dublin, that is in the village of Donnybrook,
as I tould your hanner before.&nbsp; It was to the trade of bricklaying
I was bred, and bricklaying I followed till at last, getting my leg
smashed, not by falling off the ladder, but by a row in the fair, I
was obliged to give it up, for how could I run up the ladder with a
patten on my foot, which they put on to make my broken leg as long as
the other.&nbsp; Well, your hanner; being obliged to give up my bricklaying,
I took to fiddling, to which I had always a natural inclination, and
played about the streets, and at fairs, and wakes, and weddings.&nbsp;
At length some Orange men getting acquainted with me, and liking my
style of playing, invited me to their lodge, where they gave me to drink,
and tould me that if I would change my religion and join them, and play
their tunes, they would make it answer my purpose.&nbsp; Well, your
hanner, without much stickling I gave up my Popery, joined the Orange
lodge, learned the Orange tunes, and became a regular Protestant boy,
and truly the Orange men kept their word, and made it answer my purpose.&nbsp;
O the meat and drink I got, and the money I made by playing at the Orange
lodges and before the processions when the Orange men paraded the streets
with their Orange colours.&nbsp; And O, what a day for me was the glorious
first of July when with my whole body covered with Orange ribbons I
fiddled &ldquo;Croppies Lie Down&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Boyne Water,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Protestant Boys&rdquo; before the procession which walked
round Willie&rsquo;s figure on horseback in College Green, the man and
horse all ablaze with Orange colours.&nbsp; But nothing lasts under
the sun, as your hanner knows; Orangeism began to go down; the Government
<!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>scowled
at it, and at last passed a law preventing the Protestant boys dressing
up the figure on the first of July, and walking round it.&nbsp; That
was the death-blow of the Orange party, your hanner; they never recovered
it, but began to despond and dwindle, and I with them, for there was
scarcely any demand for Orange tunes.&nbsp; Then Dan O&rsquo;Connell
arose with his emancipation and repale cries, and then instead of Orange
processions and walkings, there were Papist processions and mobs, which
made me afraid to stir out, lest knowing me for an Orange fiddler, they
should break my head, as the boys broke my leg at Donnybrook fair.&nbsp;
At length some of the repalers and emancipators knowing that I was a
first-rate hand at fiddling came to me, and tould me, that if I would
give over playing &ldquo;Croppies Lie Down&rdquo; and other Orange tunes,
and would play &ldquo;Croppies Get Up,&rdquo; and what not, and become
a Catholic and a repaler, and an emancipator, they would make a man
of me&mdash;so as my Orange trade was gone, and I was half-starved,
I consinted, not however till they had introduced me to Daniel O&rsquo;Connell,
who called me a credit to my country, and the Irish Horpheus, and promised
me a sovereign if I would consint to join the cause, as he called it.&nbsp;
Well, your hanner, I joined with the cause and became a Papist, I mane
a Catholic once more, and went at the head of processions, covered all
over with green ribbons, playing &ldquo;Croppies Get Up,&rdquo; &ldquo;Granny
Whale,&rdquo; and the like.&nbsp; But, your hanner; though I went the
whole hog with the repalers and emancipators, they did not make their
words good by making a man of me.&nbsp; Scant and sparing were they
in the mate and drink, and yet more sparing in the money, and Daniel
O&rsquo;Connell never gave me the sovereign which he promised me.&nbsp;
No, your hanner, though I played &ldquo;Croppies Get Up,&rdquo; till
my fingers ached, as I stumped before him and his mobs and processions,
he never gave me the sovereign: unlike your hanner who gave me the <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>shilling
ye promised me for playing &ldquo;Croppies Lie Down,&rdquo; Daniel O&rsquo;Connell
never gave me the sovereign he promised me for playing &ldquo;Croppies
Get Up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Och, your hanner, I often wished the ould Orange
days were back again.&nbsp; However as I could do no better I continued
going the whole hog with the emancipators and repalers and Dan O&rsquo;Connell;
I went the whole animal with them till they had got emancipation; and
I went the whole animal with them till they nearly got repale&mdash;when
all of a sudden they let the whole thing drop&mdash;Dan and his party
having frighted the Government out of its seven senses, and gotten all
they thought they could get, in money and places, which was all they
wanted, let the whole hullabaloo drop, and of course myself, who formed
part of it.&nbsp; I went to those who had persuaded me to give up my
Orange tunes, and to play Papist ones, begging them to give me work;
but they tould me very civilly that they had no farther occasion for
my services.&nbsp; I went to Daniel O&rsquo;Connell reminding him of
the sovereign he had promised me, and offering if he gave it me to play
&ldquo;Croppies Get Up&rdquo; under the nose of the lord-lieutenant
himself; but he tould me that he had not time to attend to me, and when
I persisted, bade me go to the Divil and shake myself.&nbsp; Well, your
hanner, seeing no prospect for myself in my own country, and having
incurred some little debts, for which I feared to be arrested, I came
over to England and Wales, where with little content and satisfaction
I have passed seven years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;thank you for your history&mdash;farewell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stap, your hanner; does your hanner think that the
Orange will ever be out of the kennel, and that the Orange boys will
ever walk round the brass man and horse in College Green as they did
of ould?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who knows?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;But suppose
all that were to happen, what would it signify to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why then Divil in my patten if I would not go back
<!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>to
Donnybrook and Dublin, hoist the Orange cockade, and become as good
an Orange boy as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and give up Popery for
the second time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would, your hanner; and why not? for in spite of
what I have heard Father Toban say, I am by no means certain that all
Protestants will be damned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Farewell,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Farewell, your hanner, and long life and prosperity
to you!&nbsp; God bless your hanner and your Orange face.&nbsp; Ah,
the Orange boys are the boys for keeping faith.&nbsp; They never served
me as Dan O&rsquo;Connell and his dirty gang of repalers and emancipators
did.&nbsp; Farewell, your hanner, once more; and here&rsquo;s another
scratch of the illigant tune your hanner is so fond of, to cheer up
your hanner&rsquo;s ears upon your way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And long after I had left him I could hear him playing on
his fiddle in first-rate style the beautiful tune of &lsquo;Down, down,
Croppies Lie Down.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>CHAPTER
XXX&mdash;&ldquo;WILD WALES&rdquo; (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p>Much more than in any of his other books Borrow is the hero in &ldquo;Wild
Wales&rdquo;&mdash;a strange black-coated gentleman with white hair
striding over the hills and along the rivers, carrying an umbrella,
asking innumerable questions and giving infinite information about history,
literature, religion, politics, and minor matters, willing to talk to
anyone, but determined not to put up at a trampers&rsquo; hostelry.&nbsp;
The Irish at Chester took him for a minister, the Irish reapers in Anglesey
took him for a priest and got him to bless them in Latin while they
knelt.&nbsp; All wondered to hear the Saxon speaking or reading in Welsh.&nbsp;
A man who could speak Spanish addressed him in that language as a foreigner&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t tell you how it was, sir,&rsquo; said he, looking me very
innocently in the face, &lsquo;but I was forced to speak Spanish to
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; At Pentre Dwr the man with the pigs heard his
remarks on pigs and said: &ldquo;I see you are in the trade and understand
a thing or two.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man on the road south to Tregaron told
him that he looked and spoke like the Earl of Leicester.</p>
<p>He reveals himself also without recourse to impartial men upon the
road.&nbsp; The mere figure of the tall man inquiring for the birthplaces
of poets and literally translating place names for their meaning, is
very powerful in holding the attention.&nbsp; He does not conceal his
opinions.&nbsp; Some were already familiar to readers of Borrow, his
admiration for Smollett and for Scott as a writer, his hate of gentility,
Cavaliers, Papists, France, sherry, and teetotalism.&nbsp; He had some
bad ale in Wales, and he had some Allsopp, which he <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>declared
good enough for the summer, and at Bala one of his best Welshmen gave
him the best of home-brewed, &ldquo;rich and mellow, with scarcely any
smack of the hop in it, and though so pale and delicate to the eye nearly
as strong as brandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Chester ale he spirted out of
the window after the Chester cheese.&nbsp; To his subjects of admiration
he also adds Robert Southey, as &ldquo;not the least of Britain&rsquo;s
four great latter poets, decidedly her best prose writer, and probably
the purest and most noble character to which she has ever given birth&rdquo;;
but this was when he was thinking of Madoc, the Welsh discoverer of
America.&nbsp; I should be sorry to have to name any of the other &ldquo;four
poets&rdquo; except Byron.&nbsp; Another literary <i>dictum</i> is that
Macpherson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ossian&rdquo; is genuine because a book which
followed it and was undoubtedly genuine bore a strong resemblance to
it.&nbsp; An opinion that shows as fully as any single one could Borrow&rsquo;s
vivid and vague inaccuracy and perversity is this of Snowdon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is from its connection with romance that Snowdon derives
its chief interest.&nbsp; Who when he thinks of Snowdon does not associate
it with the heroes of romance, Arthur and his knights? whose fictitious
adventures, the splendid dreams of Welsh and Breton minstrels, many
of the scenes of which are the valleys and passes of Snowdon, are the
origin of romance, before which what is classic has for more than half
a century been waning, and is perhaps eventually destined to disappear.&nbsp;
Yes, to romance Snowdon is indebted for its interest and consequently
for its celebrity; but for romance Snowdon would assuredly not be what
it at present is, one of the very celebrated hills of the world, and
to the poets of modern Europe almost what Parnassus was to those of
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who associates Snowdon with Arthur, and what Arthurian stories have
the valleys and passes of Snowdon for their scenes? what &ldquo;poets
of modern Europe&rdquo; have <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>sung
of it?&nbsp; And yet Borrow has probably often carried this point with
his reader.</p>
<p>Borrow as a Christian is very conspicuous in this book.&nbsp; He
cannot speak of Sir Henry Morgan without calling him &ldquo;a scourge
of God on the cruel Spaniards of the New World. . . . On which account
God prospered and favoured him, permitting him to attain the noble age
of ninety.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was fond of discovering the hand of God,
for example, in changing a nunnery&mdash;&ldquo;a place devoted to gorgeous
idolatry and obscene lust&rdquo;&mdash;into a quiet old barn: &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;
he asks, &ldquo;the hand of God is visible here?&rdquo; and the respectful
mower answers: &ldquo;It is so, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same way, when
he has told a man called Dafydd Tibbot, that he is a Frenchman&mdash;&ldquo;Dearie
me, sir, am I indeed?&rdquo; says the man, very pleased&mdash;he supposes
the man a descendant of a proud, cruel, violent Norman, for the descendants
of proud, cruel and violent men &ldquo;are doomed by God to come to
the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tells us that he comforted himself, after
thinking that his wife and daughter and himself would before long be
dead, by the reflection that &ldquo;such is the will of Heaven, and
that Heaven is good.&rdquo;&nbsp; He showed his respect for Sunday by
going to church and hesitating to go to Plynlimmon&mdash;&ldquo;It is
really not good to travel on the Sunday without going into a place of
worship.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wished, as he passed Gwynfe, which means Paradise,&mdash;or
<i>Gwynfa</i> does; but no matter,&mdash;that he had never read Tom
Payne, who &ldquo;thinks there&rsquo;s not such a place as Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He lectures a poet&rsquo;s mistress for not staying with her hunchbacked
old husband and making him comfortable: he expresses satisfaction at
the poet&rsquo;s late repentance.&nbsp; After praising Dafydd as the
Welsh Ovid and Horace and Martial, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, he was something more; he was what not one of the
great Latin poets was, a Christian; that is, in his latter days, when
he began to feel the vanity of all human pursuits, when his nerves began
to be unstrung, his <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>hair
to fall off, and his teeth to drop out, and he then composed sacred
pieces entitling him to rank with&mdash;we were going to say C&aelig;dmon&mdash;had
we done so we should have done wrong; no uninspired poet ever handled
sacred subjects like the grand Saxon Skald&mdash;but which entitle him
to be called a great religious poet, inferior to none but the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
of Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Here, by the way, he omits to correct the plural unity of the &ldquo;Quarterly
Reviewer.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>But perhaps these remarks are not more than the glib commonplaces
of a man who had found Christianity convenient, but not exactly sufficient.&nbsp;
In another place he says: &ldquo;The wisest course evidently is to combine
a portion of the philosophy of the tombstone with a portion of the philosophy
of the publican and something more, to enjoy one&rsquo;s pint and pipe
and other innocent pleasures, and to think every now and then of death
and judgment&mdash;that is what I intend to do, and indeed is what I
have done for the last thirty years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is as much as
to say that he was of &ldquo;the religion of all sensible men&rdquo;:
which is as much as to say that he did not greatly trouble about such
matters.</p>
<p>In the cognate matter of patriotism Borrow is superficially more
unsound in &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Birmingham railway station
he &ldquo;became a modern Englishman, enthusiastically proud of modern
England&rsquo;s science and energy&rdquo;; at the sight of Norman castles
he felt no Norman enthusiasm, but only hate for the Norman name, which
he associated with &ldquo;the deflowering of helpless Englishwomen,
the plundering of English homesteads, and the tearing out of Englishmen&rsquo;s
eyes&rdquo;; but when he was asked on Snowdon if he was a Breton, he
replied: &ldquo;I wish I was, or anything but what I am, one of a nation
amongst whom any knowledge save what relates to money-making and over-reaching
is looked upon as a disgrace.&nbsp; I am ashamed to say that I <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>am
an Englishman.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at Gutter Fawr he gloomily expressed
the opinion that we were not going to beat the Russians&mdash;&ldquo;the
Russians are a young nation and we are an old; they are coming on and
we are going off; every dog has its day.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was mere
refractoriness.&nbsp; England had not asked his advice; she had moreover
joined forces with her old enemy, France: the patriot therefore hoped
that she would perish to fulfil his own prophecy that she must.&nbsp;
And after the vaticination he sat down to a large dish of veal cutlets,
fried bacon and potatoes, with a jug of ale, and &ldquo;made one of
the best suppers he ever made in his life,&rdquo; finally &ldquo;trifling&rdquo;
with some whisky and water.&nbsp; That is &ldquo;the religion of every
sensible man,&rdquo; which is Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s phrase, I believe,
but my interpretation.</p>

XXXI&mdash;&ldquo;WILD WALES&rdquo;: STYLE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; having been written from a tourist&rsquo;s
note books is less flowing than &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; and
less delicate than &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A man is often called an &ldquo;individual,&rdquo; the sun is called
&ldquo;the candle of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; A book just bought is &ldquo;my
late literary acquisition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Facts such as &ldquo;I returned
to Llangollen by nearly the same way by which I had come,&rdquo; abound.&nbsp;
Sentences straight from his note book, lacking either in subject or
predicate, occur here and there.&nbsp; At times a clause with no sort
of value is admitted, as when, forgetting the name of Kilvey Hill, he
says that Swansea town and harbour &ldquo;are overhung on the side of
the east by a lofty green mountain with a Welsh name, no doubt exceedingly
appropriate, but which I regret to say has escaped my memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than once his direct simplicity slips into what could hardly
have been supposed to be within the power of such a pen, as in this
conclusion to a chapter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How one enjoys one&rsquo;s supper at one&rsquo;s inn, after
a good day&rsquo;s walk, provided one has the proud and glorious consciousness
of being able to pay one&rsquo;s reckoning on the morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is the reader ever allowed to forget that a massive unfeeling
Victorianism is the basis of Borrow&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; Thus he tells
the story of the Treachery of the Long Knives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hengist, wishing to become paramount in Southern Britain,
thought that the easiest way to accomplish his wish would be by destroying
the South British chieftains.&nbsp; Not believing that he should be
able to make away with them <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>by
open force, he determined to see what he could do by treachery.&nbsp;
Accordingly he invited the chieftains to a banquet, to be held near
Stonehenge, or the Hanging Stones, on Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; The unsuspecting
chieftains accepted the invitation, and on the appointed day repaired
to the banquet, which was held in a huge tent.&nbsp; Hengist received
them with a smiling countenance, and every appearance of hospitality,
and caused them to sit down to table, placing by the side of every Briton
one of his own people.&nbsp; The banquet commenced and all seemingly
was mirth and hilarity.&nbsp; Now Hengist had commanded his people that,
when he should get up and cry &lsquo;nemet eoure saxes,&rsquo; that
is, take your knives, each Saxon should draw his long sax, or knife,
which he wore at his side, and should plunge it into the throat of his
neighbour.&nbsp; The banquet went on, and in the midst of it, when the
unsuspecting Britons were revelling on the good cheer which had been
provided for them, and half-drunken with the mead and beer which flowed
in torrents, uprose Hengist, and with a voice of thunder uttered the
fatal words, &lsquo;nemet eoure saxes&rsquo;; the cry was obeyed, each
Saxon grasped his knife, and struck with it at the throat of his defenceless
neighbour.&nbsp; Almost every blow took effect; only three British chieftains
escaping from the banquet of blood.&nbsp; This infernal carnage the
Welsh have appropriately denominated the treachery of the long knives.&nbsp;
It will be as well to observe that the Saxons derived their name from
the saxes, or long knives, which they wore at their sides, and at the
use of which they were terribly proficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, Borrow&rsquo;s personal vitality triumphs, as it does over
his many mistakes, such as Lledach for Clydach, in Welsh orthography.&nbsp;
There is perhaps hardly such a thing as prose which shall be accounted
perfect by every different age: but what is most important of all, the
harmony of style which gradually steals upon <!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>the
reader and subjects him to incalculable minor effects, is not the property
of any one age, but of every age; and Victorian prose in general, and
Borrow&rsquo;s in particular, attains it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo;
is rough in grain; it can be long-winded, slovenly and dull: but it
can also be read; and if the whole, or any large portion, be read continuously
it will give a lively and true impression of a beautiful, diverse country,
of a distinctive people, and of a number of vivid men and women, including
Borrow himself.&nbsp; It is less rich than &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo;
less atmospheric than &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is Borrow&rsquo;s
for reasons which lie open to the view, not on account of any hidden
pervasive quality.&nbsp; Thus what exaggeration there is may easily
be seen, as when a fallow deer is described as equal to a bull in size,
or when carn-lleidyr is said to be one &ldquo;who, being without house
and home, was more desperate than other thieves, and as savage and brutish
as the wolves and foxes with whom he occasionally shared his pillow,
the earn.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a rule he keeps us upon an everyday normal
plane.&nbsp; The bard of Anglesey and the man who attends upon him come
through no ivory gate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They saluted me; I returned their salutation, and then we
all three stood still looking at one another.&nbsp; One of the men was
rather a tall figure, about forty, dressed in grey, or pepper-and-salt,
with a cap of some kind on his head, his face was long and rather good-looking,
though slightly pock-broken.&nbsp; There was a peculiar gravity upon
it.&nbsp; The other person was somewhat about sixty&mdash;he was much
shorter than his companion, and much worse dressed&mdash;he wore a hat
that had several holes in it, a dusty, rusty black coat, much too large
for him; ragged yellow velveteen breeches, indifferent fustian gaiters,
and shoes, cobbled here and there, one of which had rather an ugly bulge
by the side near the toes.&nbsp; His mouth was exceedingly wide, and
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>his
nose remarkably long; its extremity of a deep purple; upon his features
was a half-simple smile or leer; in his hand was a long stick.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>My last example shall be the house of Dolau Cothi, near Pumpsaint,
in Caermarthenshire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After breakfast I departed for Llandovery.&nbsp; Presently
I came to a lodge on the left-hand beside an ornamental gate at the
bottom of an avenue leading seemingly to a gentleman&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp;
On inquiring of a woman who sat at the door of the lodge to whom the
grounds belonged, she said to Mr. Johnes, and that if I pleased I was
welcome to see them.&nbsp; I went in and advanced along the avenue,
which consisted of very noble oaks; on the right was a vale in which
a beautiful brook was running north and south.&nbsp; Beyond the vale
to the east were fine wooded hills.&nbsp; I thought I had never seen
a more pleasing locality, though I saw it to great disadvantage, the
day being dull, and the season the latter fall.&nbsp; Presently, on
the avenue making a slight turn, I saw the house, a plain but comfortable
gentleman&rsquo;s seat with wings.&nbsp; It looked to the south down
the dale.&nbsp; &lsquo;With what satisfaction I could live in that house,&rsquo;
said I to myself, &lsquo;if backed by a couple of thousands a-year.&nbsp;
With what gravity could I sign a warrant in its library, and with what
dreamy comfort translate an ode of Lewis Glyn Cothi, my tankard of rich
ale beside me.&nbsp; I wonder whether the proprietor is fond of the
old bard and keeps good ale.&nbsp; Were I an Irishman instead of a Norfolk
man I would go in and ask him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the merit of this the whole book, perhaps the whole of Borrow&rsquo;s
work, contributes.&nbsp; Simple-looking tranquil successes of this kind
are the privilege of a master, and when they occur they proclaim the
master with a voice which, though gentle, will find but few confessing
to be deaf to it.&nbsp; They are not frequent in &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow had set himself too difficult a task to succeed altogether <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>with
his methods and at his age.&nbsp; Wales was not unknown land; De Quincey,
Shelley, and Peacock, had been there in his own time; and Borrow had
not sufficient impulse or opportunity to transfigure it as he had done
Spain; nor had he the time behind him, if he had the power still, to
treat it as he had done the country of his youth in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>CHAPTER
XXXII&mdash;&ldquo;ROMANO LAVO-LIL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Ambition, with a little revenge, helped to impel Borrow to write
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
of this ambition was left over for &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; which he
began and finished before the publication of &ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was little of any impulse left for the writing of books after
&ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1862 and 1863 he published in &ldquo;Once
a Week&rdquo; some translations in prose and verse, from Manx, Russian,
Danish and Norse&mdash;one poem, on Harald Harfagr, being illustrated
by Frederick Sandys.&nbsp; He never published the two-volume books,
advertised as &ldquo;ready for the press&rdquo; in 1857, &ldquo;Celtic
Bards, Chiefs, and Kings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kaempe Viser . . . translated
from the Ancient Danish,&rdquo; &ldquo;Northern Skalds, Kings and Earls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was living in Hereford Square, seeing many people, occasionally
dining well, walking out into the suburban country, and visiting the
Gypsy camps in London.&nbsp; He made notes of his observations and conversations,
which, says Knapp, &ldquo;are not particularly edifying,&rdquo; whatever
that may mean.&nbsp; Knapp gives one example from the manuscript, describing
the race at Brompton, on October 14, 1861, between Deerfoot, the Seneca
Indian, and Jackson, the &ldquo;American Deer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow also
wrote for the &ldquo;Antiquities of the Royal School of Norwich,&rdquo;
an autobiography too long for insertion.&nbsp; This survived to be captured
and printed by Knapp.&nbsp; It is very inaccurate, but it serves to
corroborate parts of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and its inaccuracy, though
now transparent, is characteristically exaggerated or picturesque.</p>
<p><!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Borrow&rsquo;s
scattered notes would perhaps never have been published in his lifetime,
but for an accident.&nbsp; In 1870 Charles Godfrey Leland, author of
&ldquo;Hans Breitmann,&rdquo; introduced himself to Borrow as one who
had read &ldquo;The Zincali,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Romany Rye,&rdquo; five times.&nbsp; Borrow answered that he would be
pleased to see him at any time.&nbsp; They met and Leland sent Borrow
his &ldquo;Breitmann Ballads&rdquo; because of the German Romany ballad
in it, and his &ldquo;Music Lesson of Confucius&rdquo; because of the
poem in it inspired by Borrow&rsquo;s reference to Svend Vonved in &ldquo;The
Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leland confessed in a genial familiar way what
&ldquo;an incredible influence&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s books had had on
him, and thanked him for the &ldquo;instructions in &lsquo;The Romany
Rye&rsquo; as to taking care of a horse on a thirty-mile ride.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow became jealous of this American &ldquo;Romany Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Leland, suspecting nothing, wrote offering him the dedication of his
&ldquo;English Gypsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Murray assured Leland that
Borrow received this letter, but it was never acknowledged except by
the speedy announcement of a new book&mdash;&ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil:
a word book of the Romany or English Gypsy Language, by George Borrow,
with specimens of Gypsy poetry, and an account of certain Gypsyries
or places inhabited by them, and of various things relating to Gypsy
life in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leland speaks of the affair in &ldquo;The
Gypsies,&rdquo; saying that he had nothing but pleasant memories of
the good old Romany Rye:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grand old fellow he was&mdash;a fresh and hearty giant,
holding his six-feet-two or three inches as uprightly at eighty as he
ever had at eighteen.&nbsp; I believe that was his age, but may be wrong.&nbsp;
Borrow was like one of the old Norse heroes, whom he so much admired,
or an old-fashioned Gypsy bruiser, full of craft and merry tricks.&nbsp;
One of these he played on me, and I bear him no malice for it.&nbsp;
The manner of the joke was this: I had written <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>a
book on the English Gypsies and their language; but before I announced
it, I wrote a letter to Father George, telling him that I proposed to
print it, and asking his permission to dedicate it to him.&nbsp; He
did not answer the letter, but &lsquo;worked the tip&rsquo; promptly
enough, for he immediately announced in the newspapers on the following
Monday his &lsquo;Word-book of the Romany Language,&rsquo; &lsquo;with
many pieces in Gypsy, illustrative of the way of speaking and thinking
of the English Gypsies, with specimens of their poetry, and an account
of various things relating to Gypsy life in England.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
was exactly what I had told him that my book would contain. . . . I
had no ill-feeling about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My obligations to him for &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Romany Rye&rsquo; and his other works are such as I owe to few men.&nbsp;
I have enjoyed Gypsying more than any other sport in the world, and
I owe my love of it to George Borrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English Gypsies&rdquo; appeared in 1873, and the &ldquo;Romano
Lavo-Lil&rdquo; in 1874.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil&rdquo; contains a note on the English Gypsy
language, a word-book, some Gypsy songs and anecdotes with English translations,
a list of Gypsy names of English counties and towns, and accounts of
several visits to Gypsy camps in London and the country.&nbsp; It was
hastily put together, and the word-book, for example, did not include
all the Romany used in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany
Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were now critics capable of discovering other
shortcomings.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s book was reviewed along with Leland&rsquo;s &ldquo;English
Gypsies&rdquo; and Dr. Miklosich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dialects and Migrations
of the Gypsies in Europe,&rdquo; and he was attacked for his derivations,
his ignorance of philology and of other writers on his subject, his
sketchy knowledge of languages, his interference with the purity of
the idiom in his Romany <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>specimens.&nbsp;
His Gypsy songs were found interesting, his translations, of course,
bad.&nbsp; The final opinion of the book as a book on the Gypsy language
was: <a name="citation310"></a><a href="#footnote310">{310}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether or not Mr. Borrow has in the course of his long experience
become the <i>deep</i> Gypsy which he has always been supposed to be,
we cannot say; but it is certain that his present book contains little
more than he gave to the public forty years ago, and does not by any
means represent the present state of knowledge on the subject.&nbsp;
But at the present day, when comparative philology has made such strides,
and when want of accurate scholarship is as little tolerated in strange
and remote languages as in classical literature, the &lsquo;Romano Lavo-Lil&rsquo;
is, to speak mildly, an anachronism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor, apart from the word-book and Gypsy specimens, is the book a
good example of Borrow&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; The accounts of visits
to Gypsies at Kirk Yetholm, Wandsworth, Pottery Lane (Notting Hill),
and Friar&rsquo;s Mount (Shore-ditch), are interesting as much for what
they tell us of Borrow&rsquo;s recreations in London as for anything
else.&nbsp; The portrait of the &ldquo;dark, mysterious, beautiful,
terrible&rdquo; Mrs. Cooper, the story of Clara Bosvil, the life of
Ryley Bosvil&mdash;&ldquo;a thorough Gypsy, versed in all the arts of
the old race, had two wives, never went to church, and considered that
when a man died he was cast into the earth, and there was an end of
him&rdquo;&mdash;and his death and burial ceremony, and some of Borrow&rsquo;s
own opinions, for example, in favour of Pontius Pilate and George IV.&mdash;these
are simple and vigorous in the old style.&nbsp; They show that with
a sufficient impulse he could have written another book at least equal
to &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these uneven fragments were not
worthy of the living man.&nbsp; They were the sort of thing that his
friends might have been expected to gather up after <!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>he
was dead.&nbsp; Scraps like this from &ldquo;Wisdom of the Egyptians,&rdquo;
are well enough:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father, why were worms made?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My
son, that moles might live by eating them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My father,
why were moles made?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My son, that you and I might
live by catching them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My father, why were you and
I made?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My son, that worms might live by eating
us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Related to Borrow, and to a living Gypsy, by Borrow&rsquo;s pen,
how much better!&nbsp; It is a book that can be browsed on again and
again, but hardly ever without this thought.&nbsp; It was the result
of ambition, and might have been equal to its predecessors, but competition
destroyed the impulse of ambition and spoilt the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil&rdquo; was his last book.&nbsp; For posthumous
publication he left only &ldquo;The Turkish Jester; or, The Pleasantries
of Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi, translated from the Turkish by G. B.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Ipswich, 1884).&nbsp; This was a string of the sayings and adventures
of one Cogia, in this style: &ldquo;One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi
said: &lsquo;O Mussulmen, give thanks to God Most High that He did not
give the camel wings; for had He given them, they would have perched
upon your houses and chimneys, and have caused them to tumble down upon
your heads.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This may have been the translation from
the Turkish that Fitzgerald read in 1857 and could not admire.&nbsp;
It is a diverting book and illustrates Borrow&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<h2><!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>CHAPTER
XXXIII&mdash;LAST YEARS</h2>
<p>From 1860 to 1874 Borrow lived at Brompton, and perhaps because he
wrote few letters these years seem to have been more cheerful, except
at the time of his wife&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He is seen at &ldquo;The
Star and Garter&rdquo; in 1861 entertaining Murray and two others at
dinner, in a heavy and expensive style.&nbsp; He is still an uncomfortable,
unattractive figure in a drawing-room, especially with accurate and
intelligent ladies, like Miss Frances Power Cobbe, who would not humour
his inaccurate dictatorship.&nbsp; Miss Cobbe was his neighbour in Hereford
Square.&nbsp; She says that if he was not a Gypsy by blood he ought
to have been one; she &ldquo;never liked him, thinking him more or less
of a hypocrite,&rdquo; but nevertheless invited him to her house and
tried to console him in his bereavement by a gentle tact which was not
tact in Borrow&rsquo;s case:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Borrow is in a sad state.&nbsp; I hope he is starting
in a day or two for Scotland.&nbsp; I sent C--- with a note begging
him to come and eat the Welsh mutton you sent me to-day, and he sent
back word, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, an hour afterwards, he arrived,
and in a most agitated manner said he had come to say &lsquo;he would
rather not.&nbsp; He would not trouble anyone with his sorrows.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I made him sit down, and talked to him as gently as possible, saying:
&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t be a trouble, Mr. Borrow, it will be a pleasure
to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was all of no use.&nbsp; He was so cross,
so <i>rude</i>, I had the greatest difficulty in talking to him.&nbsp;
I asked him would he look at the photos of the Siamese, and he said:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t show them to me!&rsquo;&nbsp; So, in despair, as
he sat silent, I told him <!-- page 3113--><a name="page3113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3113</span>I
had been at a pleasant dinner-party the night before, and had met Mr.
L---, who told me of certain curious books of medi&aelig;val history.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did he know them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, and he <i>dared say</i>
Mr. L--- did not, either!&nbsp; Who was Mr. L---?&rsquo;&nbsp; I described
that <i>obscure</i> individual (one of the foremost writers of the day),
and added that he was immensely liked by everybody.&nbsp; Whereupon
Borrow repeated at least twelve times, &lsquo;Immensely liked!&nbsp;
As if a man could be immensely liked!&rsquo; quite insultingly.&nbsp;
To make a diversion (I was very patient with him as he was in trouble)
I said I had just come home from the Lyell&rsquo;s and had heard . .
. But there was no time to say what I had heard!&nbsp; Mr. Borrow asked:
&lsquo;Is that old Lyle I met here once, the man who stands at the door
(of some den or other) and <i>bets</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; I explained who
Sir Charles was (of course he knew very well), but he went on and on,
till I said gravely: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you meet those sort
of people here, Mr. Borrow&mdash;we don&rsquo;t associate with Blacklegs,
exactly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cantankerous man, and as little fitted for Miss Cobbe as Miss Cobbe
for him.</p>
<p class="picture">
<a href="images/page313b.jpg">
<img alt="Francis Power Cobbe.  (Reproduced by kind permission of Messrs. Miller, Taylor and Holmes.)" src="images/page313s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There is not one pleasant story of Borrow in a drawing-room.&nbsp;
His great and stately stature, his bright &ldquo;very black&rdquo; or
&ldquo;soft brown&rdquo; eyes, thick white hair, and smooth oval face,
his &ldquo;loud rich voice&rdquo; that could be menacing with nervousness
when he was roused, his &ldquo;bold heroic air,&rdquo; <a name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313">{313}</a>
ever encased in black raiment to complete the likeness to a &ldquo;colossal
clergyman,&rdquo; never seemed to go with any kind of furniture, wall-paper,
or indoor company where there were strangers who might pester him.&nbsp;
His physical vigour endured, though when nearing sixty he is said to
have lamented that he was childless, saying mournfully: &ldquo;I shall
soon not be able to knock a man down, and I have no son <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>to
do it for me.&rdquo; <a name="citation314a"></a><a href="#footnote314a">{314a}</a>&nbsp;
No record remains of his knocking any man down.&nbsp; But, at seventy,
he could have walked off with E. J. Trelawny, Shelley&rsquo;s friend,
under his arm, and was not averse to putting up his &ldquo;dukes&rdquo;
to a tramp if necessary. <a name="citation314b"></a><a href="#footnote314b">{314b}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At Ascot in 1872 he intervened when two or three hundred soldiers from
Windsor were going to wreck a Gypsy camp for some affront.&nbsp; Amid
the cursing and screaming and brandishing of belts and tent-rods appeared
&ldquo;an arbiter, a white-haired brown-eyed calm Colossus, speaking
Romany fluently, and drinking deep draughts of ale&mdash;in a quarter
of an hour Tommy Atkins and Anselo Stanley were sworn friends over a
loving quart.&rdquo; <a name="citation314c"></a><a href="#footnote314c">{314c}</a>&nbsp;
But this is told by Hindes Groome, who said in one place that he met
Borrow once, and in another three times.&nbsp; At seventy, he would
breakfast at eight in Hereford Square, walk to Roehampton and pick up
Mr. Watts-Dunton or Mr. Hake, roam about Wimbledon Common and Richmond
Park, bathe in the Pen Ponds even if it were March and there were ice
on the water, then run about to dry, and after fasting for twelve hours
would eat a dinner at Roehampton &ldquo;that would have done Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s eyes good to see.&rdquo; <a name="citation314d"></a><a href="#footnote314d">{314d}</a>&nbsp;
He loved Richmond Park, and &ldquo;seemed to know every tree.&rdquo;
<a name="citation314e"></a><a href="#footnote314e">{314e}</a>&nbsp;
He loved also &ldquo;The Bald-faced Stag,&rdquo; in Roehampton Valley,
and over his pot of ale would talk about Jerry Abershaw, the highwayman,
and his deeds performed in the neighbourhood. <a name="citation314f"></a><a href="#footnote314f">{314f}</a>&nbsp;
If he liked old Burton and &rsquo;37 port he was willing to drink the
worst swipes if necessary. <a name="citation314g"></a><a href="#footnote314g">{314g}</a></p>
<p>At another &ldquo;Bald-faced Hind,&rdquo; above Fairlop, he used
to see the Gypsies, for it was their trysting place.&nbsp; He went in
search of them in Wandsworth and Battersea and whereever <!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>they
were to be found, from Notting Hill to Epsom Downs, though they were
corrupted by loss of liberty and, in his opinion, were destined soon
to disappear, &ldquo;merged in the dregs of the English population.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With them, as with others, his vocabulary was &ldquo;rich in picturesque
words of the high road and dingle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once he consented to
join a friend in trying Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scholar Gypsy&rdquo;
on Gypsy taste.&nbsp; The Gypsy girl was pleased with the seventeenth-century
story on which the poem is based, and with some &ldquo;lovely bits of
description,&rdquo; but she was in the main at first bewildered, and
at last unsympathetic and ran away.&nbsp; The beauty of the girl was
too much for Borrow&rsquo;s power of expression&mdash;it was &ldquo;really
quite&mdash;quite&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s companion, a
young woman with a child, was smoking a pipe, and Borrow took it out
of her mouth and asked her not to smoke till he came again, because
the child was sickly and his friend put it down to the tobacco.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It ought to be a criminal offence for a woman to smoke at all,&rdquo;
said Borrow; &ldquo;fancy kissing a woman&rsquo;s mouth that smelt of
stale tobacco&mdash;pheugh!&rdquo; <a name="citation315"></a><a href="#footnote315">{315}</a>&nbsp;
Whether this proves Borrow&rsquo;s susceptibility to female charm I
cannot say, but it seems to me rather to prove a sort of connoisseurship,
which is not the same thing.</p>
<p>Just after he was seventy, in 1874, the year of Jasper Petulengro&rsquo;s
death, Borrow left London for Oulton.&nbsp; He was no longer the walker
and winter bather of a year or two before, but was frequently at lodgings
in Norwich, and seen and noted as he walked in the streets or sat in
the &ldquo;Norfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Oulton he was much alone and was
to be heard &ldquo;by startled rowers on the lake&rdquo; chanting verses
after his fashion.&nbsp; His remarkable appearance, his solitariness
in the neglected house and tangled garden, his conversation with Gypsies

something of a legend.&nbsp; Children called after him &ldquo;Gypsy!&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Witch!&rdquo; <a name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316">{316}</a>&nbsp;
Towards the end he was joined at Oulton by his stepdaughter and her
husband, Dr. MacOubrey.&nbsp; In 1879 he was too feeble to walk a few
hundred yards, and furious with a man who asked his age.&nbsp; In 1880
he made his will.&nbsp; On July 26, 1881, when he was left entirely
alone for the day, he died, after having expected death for some time.&nbsp;
He was taken to West Brompton to be buried in that cemetery beside his
wife.</p>
<h2><!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In his introduction to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; <a name="citation317"></a><a href="#footnote317">{317}</a>
Hindes Groome gave a long list of Romany Ryes to show that Borrow was
neither the only one nor the first.&nbsp; He went on to say that there
must have been over a dozen Englishmen, in 1874, with a greater knowledge
of the Anglo-Gypsy dialect than Borrow showed in &ldquo;Romano Lavo-Lil.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He added that Borrow&rsquo;s knowledge &ldquo;of the strange history
of the Gypsies was very elementary, of their manners almost more so,
and of their folk-lore practically <i>nil</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet,
he concluded, he &ldquo;would put George Borrow above every other writer
on the Gypsies. . . . He communicates a subtle insight into Gypsydom
that is totally wanting in the works&mdash;mainly philological&mdash;of
Pott, Liebich . . . and their <i>confr&egrave;res</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hindes Groome was speaking, too, from the point of view of a Romany
student, not of a critic of human literature.&nbsp; In the same way
Borrow stands above other English writers on Spain and Wales, for the
insight and life that are lacking in the works of the authorities.</p>
<p>As a master of the living word, Borrow&rsquo;s place is high, and
it is unnecessary to make other claims for him.&nbsp; He was a wilful
roamer in literature and the world, who attained to no mastery except
over words.&nbsp; If there were many Romany Ryes before Borrow, as there
were great men before Agamemnon, there was not another Borrow, as there
was not another Homer.</p>
<p>He sings himself.&nbsp; He creates a wild Spain, a wild England,
a wild Wales, and in them places himself, the <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>Gypsies,
and other wildish men, and himself again.&nbsp; His outstanding character,
his ways and gestures, irresistible even when offensive, hold us while
he is in our presence.&nbsp; In these repressed indoor days, we like
a swaggering man who does justice to the size of the planet.&nbsp; We
run after biographies of extraordinary monarchs, poets, bandits, prostitutes,
and see in them magnificent expansions of our fragmentary, undeveloped,
or mistaken selves.&nbsp; We love strange mighty men, especially when
they are dead and can no longer rob us of property, sleep, or life:
we can handle the great hero or blackguard by the fireside as easily
as a cat.&nbsp; Borrow, as his books portray him, is admirably fitted
to be our hero.&nbsp; He stood six-feet-two and was so finely made that,
in spite of his own statement which could not be less than true, others
have declared him six-feet-three and six-feet-four.&nbsp; He could box,
ride, walk, swim, and endure hardship.&nbsp; He was adventurous.&nbsp;
He was solitary.&nbsp; He was opinionated and a bully.&nbsp; He was
mysterious: he impressed all and puzzled many.&nbsp; He spoke thirty
languages and translated their poetry into verse.</p>
<p>Moreover, he ran away.&nbsp; He ran away from school as a boy.&nbsp;
He ran away from London as a youth.&nbsp; He ran away from England as
a man.&nbsp; He ran away from West Brompton as an old man, to the Gypsyries
of London.&nbsp; He went out into the wilderness and he savoured of
it.&nbsp; His running away from London has something grand and allegorical
about it.&nbsp; It reminds me of the Welshman on London Bridge, carrying
a hazel stick which a strange old man recognised as coming from Craig-y-Dinas,
and at the old man&rsquo;s bidding he went to Craig-y-Dinas and to the
cave in it, and found Arthur and his knights sleeping and a great treasure
buried. . .</p>

<p>In these days when it is a remarkable thing if an author has his
pocket picked, or narrowly escapes being in a ship that is wrecked,
or takes poison when he is young, even the <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>outline
of Borrow&rsquo;s life is attractive.&nbsp; Like Byron, Ben Jonson,
and Chaucer, he reminds us that an author is not bound to be a nun with
a beard.&nbsp; He depicts himself continually, at all ages, and in all
conditions of pathos or pride.&nbsp; Other human beings, with few exceptions,
he depicts only in relation to himself.&nbsp; He never follows men and
women here and there, but reveals them in one or two concentrated hours;
and either he admires or he dislikes, and there is no mistaking it.&nbsp;
Thus his humour is limited by his egoism, which leads him into extravagance,
either to his own advantage or to the disadvantage of his enemies.</p>
<p>He kept good company from his youth up.&nbsp; Wistful or fancifully
envious admiration for the fortunate simple yeomen, or careless poor
men, or noble savages, or untradesmanlike fishermen, or unromanized
<i>Germani</i>, or animals who do not fret about their souls, admiration
for those in any class who are not for the fashion of these days, is
a deep-seated and ancient sentiment, akin to the sentiment for childhood
and the golden age.&nbsp; Borrow met a hundred men fit to awaken and
satisfy this admiration in an age when thousands can over-eat and over-dress
in comfort all the days of their life.&nbsp; Sometimes he shows that
he himself admires in this way, but more often he mingles with them
as one almost on an equality with them, though his melancholy or his
book knowledge is at times something of a foil.&nbsp; He introduces
us to fighting men, jockeys, thieves, and ratcatchers, without our running
any risk of contamination.&nbsp; Above all, he introduces us to the
Gypsies, people who are either young and beautiful or strong, or else
witch-like in a fierce old age.</p>
<p>Izaak Walton heard the Gypsies talking under the honeysuckle hedge
at Waltham, and the beggar virgin singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bright shines the sun, play, beggars play!<br />
Here&rsquo;s scraps enough to serve to-day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>Glanvill
told of the poor Oxford scholar who went away with the Gypsies and learnt
their &ldquo;traditional kind of learning,&rdquo; and meant soon to
leave them and give the world an account of what he had learned.&nbsp;
Men like George Morland have lived for a time with Gypsies.&nbsp; Matthew
Arnold elaborated Glanvill&rsquo;s tale in a sweet Oxford strain.&nbsp;
All these things delight us.&nbsp; Some day we shall be pleased even
with the Gypsy&rsquo;s carrion-eating and thieving, &ldquo;those habits
of the Gypsy, shocking to the moralist and sanitarian, and disgusting
to the person of delicate stomach,&rdquo; which please Mr. W. H. Hudson
&ldquo;rather than the romance and poetry which the scholar-Gypsy enthusiasts
are fond of reading into him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s Gypsies are
wild and uncoddled and without sordidness, and will not soon be superseded.&nbsp;
They are painted with a lively if ideal colouring, and they live only
in his books.&nbsp; They will not be seen again until the day of Jefferies&rsquo;
wild England, &ldquo;after London,&rdquo; shall come, and tents are
pitched amidst the ruins of palaces that had displaced earlier tents.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s England is the old England of Fielding, painted with
more intensity because even as Borrow was travelling the change was
far advanced, and when he was writing had been fulfilled.&nbsp; And
now most people have to keep off the grass, except in remotest parts
or in the neighbourhood of large towns where landowners are, to some
extent, kept in their place.&nbsp; The rivers, the very roads, are not
ours, as they were Borrow&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We go out to look for them
still, and of those who adventure with caravan, tent, or knapsack, the
majority must be consciously under Borrow&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>Yet he was no mere lover and praiser of old times.&nbsp; His London
in 1825 is more romantic than the later London of more deliberate romances:
he found it romantic; he did not merely think it would be so if only
we could see it.&nbsp; He loved the old and the wild too well to deface
his feeling by <!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>more
than an occasional comparison with the new and the refined, and these
comparisons are not effective.</p>
<p>He is best when he is without apparent design.&nbsp; As a rule if
he has a design it is too obvious: he exaggerates, uses the old-fashioned
trick of re-appearance and recognition, or breaks out into heavy eloquence
of description or meditation.&nbsp; These things show up because he
is the most &ldquo;natural&rdquo; of writers.&nbsp; His style is a modification
of the style of his age, and is without the consistent personal quality
of other vigorous men&rsquo;s, like Hazlitt or Cobbett.&nbsp; Perhaps
English became a foreign language like his other thirty.&nbsp; Thus
his books have no professional air, and they create without difficulty
the illusion of reality.&nbsp; This lack of a literary manner, this
appearance of writing like everybody else in his day, combines, with
his character and habits, to endear him to a generation that has had
its Pater and may find Stevenson too silky.</p>
<p>More than most authors Borrow appears greater than his books, though
he is their offspring.&nbsp; It is one of his great achievements to
have made his books bring forth this lusty and mysterious figure which
moves to and fro in all of them, worthy of the finest scenes and making
the duller ones acceptable.&nbsp; He is not greater than his books in
the sense that he is greater than the sum of them: as a writer he made
the most out of his life.&nbsp; But in the flesh he was a fine figure
of a man, and what he wrote has added something, swelling him to more
than human proportions, stranger and more heroical.&nbsp; So we come
to admire him as a rare specimen of the <i>genus homo</i>, who had among
other faculties that of writing English; and at last we have him armed
with a pen that is mightier than a sword, but with a sword as well,
and what he writes acquires a mythical value.&nbsp; Should his writing
ever lose the power to evoke this figure, it might suffer heavily.&nbsp;
We to-day have many temptations to over praise him, because he is a
Great Man, <!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>a
big truculent outdoor wizard, who comes to our doors with a marvellous
company of Gypsies and fellows whose like we shall never see again and
could not invent.&nbsp; When we have used the impulse he may give us
towards a ruder liberty, he may be neglected; but I cannot believe that
things so much alive as many and many a page of Borrow will ever die.</p>

Dr. Knapp was unable to decipher this word.&nbsp; He remarks in a note
that the pencillings are much rubbed and almost illegible.&nbsp; We
think, however, that the word should be Plumstone, a lofty hill which
Borrow would see just before he crossed Pelcomb Bridge.</p>

This was a low thatched cottage on the St. David&rsquo;s road, half-way
up Keeston Hill.&nbsp; A few years ago it was demolished, and a new
and more commodious building known as the Hill Arms erected on its site.</p>

The old inn was kept by the blind woman, whose name was Mrs. Lloyd.&nbsp;
Many stories are related of her wonderful cleverness in managing her
business, and it is said that no customer was ever able to cheat her
with a bad coin.&nbsp; Her blindness was the result of an attack of
small-pox when twelve years of age.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
